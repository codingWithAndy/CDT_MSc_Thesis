\chapter{Introduction}
	\label{chap:intro}
	We have set out to create a tool that can simulate a small scale comparative judgement experiment on what users think about tweets getting compared against each other. This experiment is in light of our stakeholder getting commissioned by the Welsh government to implement a comparative judgement system nationally for all schools in Wales. Comparative judgement is a technique that has been around for almost 100 years. However, while the process can improve results and reduce cognitive loads for teachers and markers, especially at the scale that the stakeholder's implementation will have to work at, it can still require many combinations to be marked and compared. For this experiment, we decided to use tweets based on Brexit.
	
	Therefore, we have created a tool that allows users to see a sub-sample of the combinations. Once the users have viewed the varieties, an overall ranking of the results will get created. Two methods got implemented, a more traditional comparative judgement method and an Elo style ranking.
	
	We then aimed to use NLP techniques to see any insights we could find within the tweets. We intended to extract information on the tweets to see if we could find patterns that would give us insights into what might have impacted the tweets final scores.
	
	The study got broken up into two parts. Part one was a web app to gather user's views on the tweets, and the second part was exploring NLP techniques within a Jupyter Notebook. With our aim to see if we can generate any feedback about the tweet.


	\section{Motivations}
		\label{sec:intro_motivation} 
	For the prior eight years, we have had involvement in some form of an educational environment. Seven of these years involve being a teacher within secondary and sixth form schools. While the focus of teaching is perceived to create lessons for students to learn and grow, we found more and more as the years went on that this wasn't the case. The focus was actually on providing reports about the students, which required data about the students from formal assessments. While having assessments to gauge the level that a student is at is an essential part of education. However, creating, marking, analysing and providing feedback for 30 students or more per class is a time-consuming task. Therefore, this assessment practice takes away the educators' time to do what is essential, creating meaningful lessons tailored for the students.
	
	Therefore, our motivation is to create a tool for educators that will empower them to allow technology to do what it is good at and focus on what they are good at, creating and delivering lessons. To shape future generations views.

	\section{New Insights}
	While the comparative judgement technique has many great features, we believe that the concept can still improve. We believe this is especially the case when the comparative judgment system gets expected to get done at a national scale. We believe this because the traditional method would expect all unique pairings to get compared. Additionally, the adaptive comparative judgement that most other systems have adopted still requires time and effort even when the number of individual student work is only around thirty. Therefore, it would be tough to do when needed to get scaled up to a national level. That is why we believe a different ranking system, like an Elo system, could replace the adaptive comparative judgement process and have a more crowed sourced approach. Therefore, reducing cognitive load and the time cost it would take for people to partake. 
	
	Furthermore, the current implementations do not provide any meaningful feedback to the students or educators about what makes a piece of work better than the other. Therefore, we think we can look into NLP techniques that can provide some form of feedback. To see if this can become something more meaningful and give some insights. Marking and giving feedback is a crucial role for all educators and the students receiving the feedback.

	\section{Results Overview}
	
	\section{Overview}  
	\label{sec:intro_overview} 
	 We will first look into the background, explaining the need education has for marking, allowing educators to rank students' work, and providing feedback to students to enable them to reflect and improve. We will then look into what comparative judgement is and its different iterations. Additionally, we look into different ranking systems, with both coming from the chess world but get currently implemented in all other scenarios, like e-Sports. We then look into what Natural Language Processing (NLP) is and some techniques to help achieve what we aim to achieve within our implementation. Then finally for this section will look at other applications that aim to implement comparative judgment within them. We will then look at our methodology, explaining the tools and design approaches we decided to use. We then look at the results we found and a discussion around these. We then finish with a conclusion and suggested further work for this project.
