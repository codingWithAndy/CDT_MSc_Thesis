"After playing this game over 100 hours in less than a month I think I'm safe to say that I was obsessed with this game. I love it to death. Was really worried I'd hyped it up too much and it wouldn't be near as good as I thought. I was completely wrong, it's better than I expected.One thing I've always loved about the Elder Scrolls games is they have open worlds. As soon as you complete the prologue/tutorial your free to do what you want. Don't feel like doing the main story? Eh you'll get to it later. Want to murder that family while they sleep and take all their belongs? Go for it, just be prepared to deal with the wave of guards trying to kill you if you get caught.Just like Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion you have a choice out of 10 different races. They are High Elf, Wood Elf, Dark Elf, Imperial, Breton, Nord, Redgaurd, Argonian, Khajiit, and Orc. All races are given extra levels in skills that race is considered good at. If you want a warrior, choose a Redgaurd or Orc. Favor a mage, then go with a Breton or High Elf. Rather a thief, then a Wood Elf or Khajiit is the best choice.What race you choose really doesn't matter if you ask me. All skill levels will raise your overall level. Elder Scrolls did away with the pick a class thing at the beginning, something I was very happy about. Each skill also has perks now to make said skill better and more effective. I favor the skills of the thief (alchemy, light armor, lock pick, sneak, pickpocket, speech craft). I'll also level up smithing, to make the best armor, and enchanting, so magic doesn't cost magicka.Oh and another thing I just loved about this game, dragons! You actually get to fight dragons! Real fire breathing, civilian eating dragons!! Oh that was something I wanted the most in Oblivion. The only other games I can think of that let me fight dragons were the Dragon Age games. There are probably a lot more, I just haven't tried them yet. They get a little annoying though when your trying to do things like hunting or gathering ingredients for potions and one attacks you. There are plenty of different types of enemies in this game so you'll never get bored of fighting the same old enemies over and over. Some can only be found in certain environments.If you've never played an open world game before and would like to try one, this is a great place to start. It is very fun and I would highly recommend it to anyone. This is a game that should not be missed."
"a great ARPG, the improvements on the mechanics over what was used for oblivion, fallout 3 and new vegas are supremely apparent. The updated graphics are also extremely welcome. One thing that bugged the crap out of me was the movement of characters in 3rd person view. This has been fixed now, and no longer bothers me. I actually enjoy 3rd person view. The leveling mechanics and skill gains have also been changed, and I think for the better. You now get small gains for smaller actions (breaking a pick, simply standing in a corner sneaking) and individual actions can improve multiple skills (sneaking and archery, or one handed)To be honest, I didn't realize I wasn't playing the main story when I was running around, slaying dragons and all sorts of things. The dungeons are all different, and I don't get turned around as often as I did in oblivion. Great game."
"A little buggy but such an amazing game it doesnt bother me a bit! One of my favorite games being Oblivion I couldnt wait for Skyrims release. Well worth the 5 yr. wait before the next installment of The Elder Scrolls blessed us with enough entertainment packed into one game to keep me busy for the next year! Love, love, love this game! Now if I could only get my hands on the official guidebook all would be perfect :) Guess the entire country is out of the book, even my beloved Amazon has them on backorder :/"
"Amazing game, cool graphics, cool gameplay, cool everything, this game its just amazing, i recommend it for all you people, i never play oblivion before but this game rocks, you can spend hours and hours and you will never get bored, always have new misions, it has style. buy it.!"
"Bethesda adds here what it left out, or what was lacking, in Oblivion IV.This is a game where you get lost in a medieval world of dragons and swords and armor and villages and heroism. It has all the elements of Oblivion IV and more... Gone are the repetitive caverns and temples. You know what I mean...after being in a few caves and temples in Oblivion, you felt as if you were in the same ones over and over. They were too similar. Quests could be repetitive. I lost interest in playing after awhile.In Skyrim, it seems that all the temples, caverns, caves, places you explore, etc... are original. There is very little of the same-old same-old, with the exception of the enemies. Though there are a few more in this game, they can get repetitive after awhile.Graphics are better and more realistic. They did improve facial expressions a little, but they could still stand a little more realism. There are more of a variety of people so you don't feel like you are speaking to the same person with a different name.The amount of side-quests are astounding. I've been playing since it first came out and I still haven't bottomed-out in the side quest department.The addition of fighting dragons is really cool. I love it! I am an avid bow & arrow user, and since dragons fly...well what more could I ask for? The use of a bow and arrow in this department makes it so much easier to battle these flying beasts! Don't get me wrong, you still have an opportunity to battle them using swords and other one and two-handed weapons if that is your preference.The story line seems a little better in this one.All in all, it is a great game you can spend countless hours immersed in! It sucks you in like a good story, which is what I think a good game should do. If you like the whole dungeons and dragons feel in gaming, this is the game for you!One thing I did want to mention is that the notorious game-freeze that frustrated so many people with Oblivion is not totally gone. Though not in the abundance you experienced it in Oblivion, it is still there never-the-less. I think in a game as vast and detailed as this, it is a small price to pay and not entirely avoidable. One thing Bethesda did to help in this area is that the game seems to automatically save the last couple of areas you entered. So if you enter a cave, and then enter a new area of a cave...it'll save both of these so that you can choose one or the other if the game happens to freeze up on you (or if you happen to get killed). So where Oblivion had one Autosave spot when you needed to reload, this one has a couple. It makes it a little more versatile. I have appreciated this feature a few times.Worth the money and your time. Check it out!"
"Bethesda games are always my favorite, but Skyrim takes the win. Weeks worth of game play and never ending quests. You will have to literally pull yourself away from the game. I love the Elder Scrolls series, and I can't wait to see them try to top this one! If your trying to decide whether or not to buy this, you will not be disappointed. Skyrim is definitely the game of the year!"
Bethesda out performed themselves with this game.  There are no bugs or glitches that I've come across (not like any other given Bethesda game).  There seems like there will be almost infinite replay value.  The main quest-line is compelling and there are plenty of other side quests and miscellaneous quests that are fun and unique to anything else I've seen in a video game.  I'm somewhere in the area of 60 hours deep into the game and I still feel like I've barely scratched the surface of things to do and explore.  This is a definite holiday purchase!As a side note - I see a lot of complaints about the Favorites List vs. the Wheel menu in Oblivion. I personally think that the favorites list is a very effective way of switching weapons/spells on the fly due to the duel wielding in the game.  I feel that reverting back to the wheel system would be inefficient.
"Everything youve loved from the previous titles and more.Scenery is gorgeous, character models are awesome. slightly Expanded crafting. Dungeons are MUCH more varied and well constructed. Lock-picking identical to Fallout series(yea!) There is just so much to love about this game its tough to pick on what to improve on so here goes.I wish that combat was more intense (more enemies) and happened more often. The dragon battles are epic in the beginning but grow tiresome quickly (after 40+).Beware giants at the start.Horses, ugh what a disaster. Slow, cumbersome, mentally handicapped, but they can climb walls....Even more crafting and gathering options would be nice.The cities are pathetic compared to Morrow-wind. I could spend an entire day in the Imperial city of morrow wind.Kind of wish leveling was based on kill/quest XP and not solely on skill advancements.Whatever.Be prepared to waste 40 hours easily on this game. I dont think they exaggerate when they say 150 hours of gameplay when including side quests. Im at 60 hours so far and wish i was playing instead of writing a review......actually F'it, time to Skyrim......."
"First things first my gaming credentials: I have logged over 200 hours into Skyrim, 100 or so of those hours on the Xbox 360 version and about a 100 or so on the PC version. I have 6 different characters currently in play, ranging from Khajiit sneak thief to Orc Barbarian to Elf wizard. I have finished much of the missions in the game and played every single faction at least once. So I have extensive time with this game, which I hope should verify my credentials to review this game.Let's start out basic:Graphics: The graphics on both platforms are a clear and vivid step up from Oblivion (which for the record was an awesome game). However because the graphics are better they have become more hardware intensive. The Xbox 360 has worse graphics than my computer, which I was expecting, but they are still nice to look at. The world around you has more of that lush feel to it than Oblivion did, which still did this aspect very well. The shadowing alone is a clear upgrade, with realistic shadowing cast upon different surfaces very well. I have often times had to use the shadows as indicators of where enemies are in dark cavernous dungeons, where the one torch in the area cast an eerie glow on everything making it a little difficult to make things out. The monsters and beasts in game are usually very graphic and intense to look at up close, especially dragons. However there were some issues that I ran into. In the Xbox version I had rendering lag in certain areas of the game that the hardware of the 360 just couldn't keep up, and on the PC version I had bodies and random objects just fall through the floor (even if this is a physics engine issue). Other than the cool spectacle of looking at massive scenery at the top of mountains, the world is very nicely created to give that epic feeling.World: The nation of Skyrim is about the same size as the map of Oblivion and has pretty much any kind of terrain that one is looking for. The most predominant feature of the terrain is snow however. You are in a mountainous region of Tamriel. Yet the surrounding areas have lush fertile forests, sprawling cities, marsh/swamp lands, and even a small desert. Skyrim is also home to the Nordic people whom seem to have a very old barbarian world kind of culture to it. Systems of politics that are based off of strength and honor, where one can challenge a Jarl (Nordic name for King) to a duel and one has to accept due to old traditions. The developers have taken a great interest in making a culture of these people that is completely different than that of Cyrodiil, the Imperial Capital. It is an ancient and merciless place where traditions reign supreme. 200 years have passed since the last game so things have changed in remarkable form. The Empire is in shambles from a war against the Aldmeri Dominion. Their hold of Skyrim as a province is falling and a brutal civil war has erupted. This game has taken social aspects into play immensely; there is prejudice and discrimination at every turn via the Nords, or others that are hateful or fearful of other Ethnic groups. All in all it is an inclusive game that can be leisurely enjoyed or played by diehard fans with greater lore and  more world explanation (Thought most of it is read through in game books that are found all of Skyrim).Classes: It has finally become the leveling system I was hoping for. You no longer have to pick exactly what you are going to be in the beginning of the game. You can allow your basic and innate abilities of adaptation to divulge what you are going to be. Your skills level up as they are used, like in Oblivion, but are not set on a couple of major skills to increase your level. All skill increases move toward your eventual Level Up. The perks of Skyrim eventually make your character a hardened warrior of incredible ability. They are what truly create the character you are going to be. Yet to achieve specialized characters, i.e. Battle Mage, one must pick and choose wisely their perks on the perk tree. So the game can go from an easy Archer skill choice to a very complex and intense leveling process to achieve the end result. However clearly as most fantasy goes certain races are more cut out to be certain classes than others. High Elves regenerate Magicka through a special ability much faster and start out with higher magic skills at the beginning of the game. That is not to say an Orc cannot become a mage, or an elf cannot be used as a barbarian, the races are designed to be as they would in real life through evolution. Yet fear not the damage output and resistances and all basic things at the very start of the game are perfectly and exactly equal. (Verified through the Console Command: player.getscale). I have gotten the complaint about the Leveling system being dumbed down, as some like to say as it gets hard at certain times to differentiate characters of very similar play styles. Now this can be agreed upon by me if basic style characters are played i.e. I am an archer character. But allow for the best possible outcome of advanced classes that take work, dedication and a very strong perk resolve to accomplish.Factions: Most of the factions that blessed Oblivion are gone and replaced with something similar, but yet completely foreign. There is no longer a Fighters Guild, or Mages Guild. The Thieves Guild and Dark Brotherhood can still be found in game and are done very similar but different at the same time. The Fighters Guild has been replaced with the Companions which operate in a very different way than the Fighters Guild ever did. The Mages Guild has also been replaced with the College of Winterhold, which once again has nothing to do with the Mages Guild, and therefore certain rules do not apply, like the ban on Necromancy. The Thieves Guild is a fraction of its former glory and it becomes your mission to return them to such. The Dark Brotherhood is still a set of assassins that do their dirty business in the shadows. There is now two social factions that you can join that can hold great sway over the game. You can join in the civil war and completely change the landscape of the cities and world permanently. I used these to change the game up and switch the people I talked to, to get a different play through for a couple different characters. Each faction has its own set of quests that can be done and thus bring the story lines of all into greater view, as well as their own armor sets and shop keepers.Enemies: This may be one of the only parts of the game that I was slightly unimpressed with. Now I understand that so much effort was given to so many other things in the game that something had to be left out in one way shape or form, but the lack of enemy diversity in this one is a little upsetting. The enemy placements are predictable, which while not a real gripe is still a little monotonous at times. The dragons are cool in the beginning as they are forces of pure death but later in the game at about level 25 to 30 they become real simple and almost dishearteningly so. You are the Dovahkin and supposed to be the slayer of dragons but then 3 guards in the nearby town slay one without issue. The Oblivion monsters are mostly gone and vanished and I have not ever found a Minotaur so I am sure that they are not in the game. Here is a list: Bear, Wolves, Sabre Cats, Skeever, Mudcrabs, Ice Wraiths, Trolls, Chaurus, bandits (mages and warriors), few Dremora and Atronachs, Zombies named Draugr, Skeletons, Vampires, Giants, Forsworn (just bandits with different armor), ghosts, Spriggans, Wisps, Dwemer Automatrons, Hagravens, and Dragon Priests (Very Strong Undead Wizards basically). Trust me it may seem like quite a few, and is certainly more additions from Oblivion but add that between 200 hours of gameplay and you have the same thing over and over again. However I understand that I have played this game quite a bit and this may just be a result of my playing it for 200+ hours so I am not going to take this in account with my numeric rating of the game.Combat: The combat has been slowed down ever so slightly from Oblivion. The damage that is inflicted is (to me at least) slightly higher than that of previous games. The ability to dual-wield blades and magic, or one of each is a great addition. So you can multitask as you battle your way through hordes of enemies and swath your way through them. Staves are now available and can be dual wielded to increase their sheer firepower, and your companions can use them (although sometimes not to the desired effect). There are many different types and categories of weapons that can be used by each character and they all seem to be beautifully rendered to increase that sense of connection that a warrior should have to their weapon. Some of the skills have been adapted to make multiple weapons usable through a single skill tree. So if you want to use a mace and then switch to a sword mid-game then it is not an issue, so long as you did not put perks into the mace specific option within the tree which can be used to specialize your character even more and make them even deadlier. Damage for each attack is based off of the skill level and perks in said tree, the same goes for magic. The modification of the combat mechanics makes the game flow a bit more smoothly and helps reduce the combat confusion that some experienced in Oblivion.Miscellaneous: This is for everything else that I want to talk about but don't feel it deserved it's very own section. The soundtrack: The music in the game seems to tie in and enhance the gaming experience perfectly. It is a great addition that does not distract and only seems to amplify the feeling and mood of the game at every twist and turn. Though there were a few times I wanted the music to play in the background but it just seemingly didn't feel it was necessary. NPCs: They are everywhere and operate very differently depending on where on the map you are at. They each seem to have their own regional culture that they like to follow and sometimes are just defaulted to the faction they follow. They offer a variety of random side quests that one can go and do to kill some time or get more loot.There was only one problem I ever found with the game. That is the Factions. The concept of these factions are cool as hell and they are pretty diverse so you can do whatever it is you really wish to do. Yet the stories for most of these factions is really rather lame. The only two ones that I found compelling and epic int he very sense of what Skyrim is, was the Dark Brotherhood, and the College of Winterhold (Mages College). Other than that the story lines for these quest get finished very quickly and you never really think twice about them.All-in-all I loved and continue to love The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim. It is for me one of the top contenders for game of the year.Graphics: 9/10Sounds and Music: 8/10Gameplay: 9/10Presentation: 9/10Replay Ability: 9/10Total: 44/50 - 8.8 Stars out of 10"
"Great game, the only reason it dosent get five statrs all across is cause i want some more add on stuff. I.e dragon riding, horse armor, ect.. But rest assured you will not be dissapointed"
"Here come the Dragons that haven't been seen for years.  What's going on?  Gear up.  Grab your weapon & rations.  It's time to get to the bottom of the situation.First off, this isn't just a game.  It's more like a commitment.  Another triumph from Bethesda.  Your standard land roaming game on a mission while taking on a side quest or two (That was obviously an understatement).  Fight your way through creatures, wild beasts, bandits, & many other things to reach your goals.You start off by designing your character.  Each race has thier own ability.  The level up system is an vast system of skills.  A little complex at first (Especially to those who never played prior Elder Scrolls series), but once you get the hang it's actually fun.  Building and tweaking your character takes quite a bit of time.  There is so much to discover in the land of Skyrim.  The more you improve your skills, the closer you get to leveling up.Quests are fun.  You can have people tag along & aide you on your quests.  Spells, weapons, & armor are incredible. The story lines are great.The only thing I can really complain about is that there were a glitch or two on the game where it would freeze during combat.  Other than that.  I truly enjoyed this game.Once again, this is a commitment.  If you are familiar with Bethesda's games (Fallout & Elder Scrolls series), you're already aware the length these games can be.  Your other games will just collect dust from hours of gaming you get with skyrim.So go out and slay a Dragon.  Skyrim is incredible."
"How to describe one of the best games ever made? No, not only one of the best games, one of the singularly best forms of entertainment ever crafted by humans. Remember in Infinite Jest when the 'Entertainment' hooks everyone so hard they give up food and human interaction, craving the video until they succumb to starvation. Well get ready! Even if you have but a fleeting interest in RPGS, you owe it to yourself to play this incredibly deep, literate, and moving game. The world is expansive, loaded with increasingly interesting (and varied) quests. You'll fight necromancers, tree-like creatures, elves, dark wizards, mud crabs, et al and of course, dragons! The storyline shant be revealed here, but it is of such a caliber other games simply diminish by comparison. Even Bethesda's sprawling hitherto greatest game (in my opinion) Fallout 3, feels insignificant in light of this marvel. Be ready to give yourself fully to this experience which is, to use a particularly shopworn neologism: a total time-suck!Minor complaints include some graphical hitches and pop-in textures (but with such a big world it would be hard for this not to happen), a couple game-ending freezes (usually accompanies too many different saves, stick with one or two to be safe) and that ever-annoying RPG thing that happens when you are in a town and people start talking over one another so it is hard to hear exactly what is being said.Those little problems aside, this is a magical and captivating entertainment you will never forget."
I base the value of a game on the amount of enjoyable gameplay I can get out of it and this one was definitely worth the price!
"If it wasn't for a few very annoying glitches..I could easily consider this game as perfect.The Good:Fights can be very challenging at times, near complete freedom in character design (no more major/minor skills as Oblivion had), large amount of areas to explore, many quests and mini-quest like misc. activities (some of which leads to quests),good scenery, etc.The game has a good music score, especially when dragons appear. Enemies can show a moderate degree of Ai, such as running or hiding behind obstacles if they can't reach you (as often happens to me when I try to snipe giants from a mountain or hillside). A few npcs can kill you in a single hit depending on what type of character you have; yet at the same time, they are not too difficult as you simply have to readjust your strategy in approaching them-brilliantly balanced.A few things are simplified from Oblivion, making character management less of a hassle and enchanting/alchemy more interesting. (Alchemy, for example-you find ingredient effects from actual experimenting)The Bad:While the game only has a few glitches..the ones it has tend to be extremely annoying. The most annoying glitch I've came across is that the game often crashes with me when leaving certain areas. Winterhold college especially; in which the game crashes nearly every time I leave it.There has also been an occasion where I couldn't use enchanting or alchemy tables and the equipment I use (archmage robes and some kind of mask) often makes my characters face invisible.These few glitches doesn't stop the game from being amazing though-and I highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys Rpgs.EDIT: My comment about challenging fights might have been in error. Unfortunately, I have noticed that this game can get ridiculously easy. Sneak attacks can one shot kill (or come close) to killing many humanoid enemies such as bandits, goblins, etc and if it doesn't..I can simply continuously stunlock them with dual casting making them completely helpless (this even applies to large enemies like dragons). Enchantments can also make magic cost practically nothing making it even easier. The game could have been balanced much better then this, but my initial rating still stands.  Basically..if you don't want the game to become a joke-try to limit your use of  enchantment and alchemy."
"I have to say this is on big game, a lot of quests, things to do & see and one very amazing world to just ride around in and explore.ProsThe world is huge and I said before great to ride around in and explore.The dragon attacks are just amazing, they somtimes come out of nowhere and just shock you.Tons of quests to do.I haven't finished the game but the storyline is very interesting.I enjoyed the crafting system.I enjoy the fact you can become a vampire or werewolf.Cons.I wish your sidequests would have more of an impact. Such as if you help out people and towns you can see changes.Especially if you become a citizen of a town and become famous enough it celebrates you.I love the crafting system, but as far as smithing goes, I wish they gave the NPC blacksmiths the option to let you buy upgrades to your weapons instead of having to wait and smith your way up enough to upgrade your own weapons.You can marry a person in the game, but other than getting some money if they run a store and having them cook you meals not much there.Overall a great fantasy rpg. This game will give your hours of fun."
"I loved the Oblivion game and that was my intro to this series and the wait for the Skyrim edition proves to be worth it....very much so.  If you've been turned off of RPG games because they had way too many this-that-and then this-that-etc...methods of using your weapons or casting a killer firebolt - then get this game, it is even more fun to play because the whole menu system is SO simple to use, yet you can do about anything you want with it.  The graphics and the game story is so well done - easy to spend months? --- and still not see all there is to see.  Even better, once played, you will come back later and play it again as another type of character, or maybe let yourself become a vampire (just get bit and don't heal yourself) - and then play with the enhanced dark abilities you gain.  For the price - cannot beat this game for hours of play and the fact that you'll re-play it again and again over time."
"I love it. It is the best game ever. There are hours of fun.I don't know if I will ever finish it, playing it slow and seeing everything."
"I love Oblivion, i beat it on PC and on Xbox 360 and is the main reason i bought a 360, of course i love RPG'S and own quit a few but this is by far the most EPIC game that i have ever played on Xbox 360! The graphics alone are breath taking and the improvment from Oblivion to Skyrim are flawless. If you like any rpg games at all then this is THE game for you. I love Square Enix but i can honestley say that Skyrim surpases EVERY RPG that has ever come before it. Stop reading reviews and BUY THIS GAME NOW!"
"i love this game! got it day one its just plain great made me put mw3 down and i didnt touch it for about two weeks later so much to do im not even half way done im a level 50 ive put in about 70 hours or so in to the game it feels fresh, story is intriguing the world comes alive people reference past events if you've helped them with quests or how u behave in the world etc.. they have their daily routines, makes you feel like a badass, armors look great, character models are very well detailed as well as the land scape, massive immersive world overall its a great game i recommend everyone buys it! 10/10!!!"
"I only played about halfway through Oblivion, because I was annoyed with the leveling process.  Well, that is fixed in Skyrim.  I love this game.  Naturally, the graphics are improved.  Now, all the races are easy on the eyes.  Some of those Oblivion races were dreadful to look at.  Pretty much anything you do, counts toward your character's level...which I think is very cool.  If you have a bunch of ore, and want to sit there to craft a bunch of stuff...well, you can leveling your Smithing, which in turn, counts towards your character's level.  Talking to folks and engaging all parts of the conversation still helps you discover new quests...and that seems to be never ending at times(not a bad thing, at all).  And hey, there are dragons!  And you get to fight them!  Right there makes it super cool.  For the sake of getting long-winded, I will stop.  I recommend this game to all, especially RPG-lovers."
"I played through the game pretty quickly. If you played the last game you will have no problem picking this one up and be wondering around in no time. Killing dragons is so much fun!! The control scheme is the same from the last one so if you liked it you will keep on liking it. I'm mixed on it. I think it could be better but I'm afraid if they mess with it too much they may just ruin it. Can't wait for some DLC for this one, I'll gladly pay for it to expand my adventure even more."
"I should probably begin by saying that RPG's have never really been my thing. I will play them on occasion, but I mostly stick to first person shooters. We all have differences when it comes to personal taste and that is just mine. That being said, I consider this game (and perhaps the Fable series) to be about the only times I significantly deviate from my normal gaming routine.This game truly redefines what most gamers are apt to think of the concept of an open world environment. I have never seen it equaled. Hell, I have never even seen another game come close. The sheer vastness and depth of the characters and NPC's boggles the mind. The developers really pulled out all the stops here to immerse you in the vivid world of their imaginations. So much so that you can literally play for a solid 8 hours straight and it feels more like maybe 1 hour tops. It sucks you in and does not let go.I am not really the type of guy that likes to share spoilers since I think you will have more fun figuring it out for yourself, but in a way, about every person out there will likely experience the game in a different way because of its very unique and adaptive nature. Trust me when I tell you that if you pick up this game that you are in for a real treat.I do have one small gripe about this game from a technical standpoint and that is the fact that I have experienced a few glitches and game freezes. I have my Xbox at school in the dorms where Live is blocked, so I was not able to download the patches right away. Now that I have, it seems to have corrected the problem for the most part and freezes and mission glitches are a thing of the past.I would not let these small technical problems deter you from wanting to play/buy this game as these are only minor concerns in the grand scope of how completely amazing this title is. Even if you are a hardcore COD person like myself, there is still much fun to be had with this one.Happy Gaming!"
"I've played my share of RPG, such as all the Elder Scrolls games since Daggerfall, the Fable series, Dragon age, and the Fallout series; but none of them match up to this. Skyrim is a beautiful game. I've also had a lot of gripes about the problems with Oblivion, and most, if not all of them are fixed. The ability to focus strictly on one particular quest line, such as the Companions warrior guild, the College of Winterhold school of magic, or the Dark Brotherhood. The main questline is also interesting. You can even ignore some of the quests all together, and simply wander the world Bethesda has created. Dragons show up occasionally, some in quests, some flying around skyrim, and you can run across them at any time. This game is a masterpiece, and the latest DLC, Dawnguard, has added even more quests. I recommend this game to anyone who looks for an open world, and are looking for something better than most of the bad RPGs *cough cough Fable 3* that are coming out these days"
"I want to preface this review by stating that the only other Elder Scrolls game that I have played was ""Oblivion"", and unfortunately I didn't put that much effort into that game and beat it quite quickly....I was very excited about getting this game because of the hype that surrounded it.  Now to start, I will mention that I am a 26 year old male, and have a full time job, live with my gf, and have a new puppy. I am very weary about getting any type of role playing game because I know that I wont have all the time to put into the game, and I didn't want to get a bad experience because of that.  Growing up, I was a HUGE RPG fan with an extreme dedication to the Final Fantasy Series.  As time passed and I got older, Final Fantasy started to change its gameplay, and with my evolving life I just couldn't devote the time.I then came across the Demon Souls game for the PS3 ... amazing ... i was hooked..... then the more recent RPG I got was Dark Souls ... again ... hooked!  I figured ""this is it, I am back to loving RPG's"".  I ended up buying this game hoping that I would be on the same stride I have been with these newer RPGs.  The game started off great!  I loved the customizability, the graphics, the voice acting ... everything was perfect and pulling me into the story!After a few days though, I started to get bored.  There are a TON of side quests to do ... almost never ending.  Although most people would love this, it isn't something that captures my attention much ... it almost gets a bit stressing when you take care of all the side quests, then talk to the random NPC's and 10 more quests pop up.  Again, many people will LOVE that ... unfortunately at my age and my current lifestyle it really doesn't give me the sense of accomplishment in a game.As mentioned previously, I am coming from games like Demon/Dark Souls, so I am used to the ""grind it out/level up as much as you can"" type of difficult RPG's.  At first this game started out that way.  There were a few main quests that I just could not beat until I did some grinding and getting my skill set up.  This was working out all in my favor...exactly what I wanted.  But then, the game started to taper off a bit.  I started to reach levels where the bosses became easy, and the quests took little to no time at all to complete.I understand that a lot of people love this game because of how it has evolved as part of the Elder Scrolls series.  People will also love it due to the number of quests, the character customization, and the tons of stuff that you can do each day in the game.  Unfortunately, for me, it just didn't satisfy my needs.  Dont get me wrong, if you are looking for a full 'sandbox' type RPG then this is the game for you!  But if you want a big challenge and a sense of accomplishment, there are better choices."
"I was going to write an enormous review on this game but after seeing how many other five star reviews there are here that adequately explain why this game is amazing I don't think I need to. One thing I will say though is that I have legitimately level capped two characters in this game, meaning I think I have enough experience to rate this game what I have.Another comment that I haven't seen from many other people: the freedomOf you to choose your controls in this game is like no other I haveseen.  You can literally custom choose which buttons you wantassigned to which abilities and controls!"
"I was told by countless friends that this is the greatest game ever. I wouldn't go that far. It isn't perfect. I find the combat less than satisfying and the load times are excrutiatingly long. However, this is probably the best 60 bucks you will ever spend on a game. It provides variety and length that no other game can offer. Its time to go on an adventure. Your way."
"My son was soooooo happy with this birthday gift, he is still thanking. Best game ever he says. It arrived much sooner than expected which made me very happy."
"Okay guys. I'm not a ""hard-core"" gamer that plays CoD, MW, GoW for endless hours, but I have to say, Skyrim has been one of the greatest games I've ever played. I'm a 21 year-old female that normally plays Zelda, Harvest Moon/Rune Factory, & Nintendogs, & Skyrim is probably one of my favorites.- The graphics are amazing- Quests are endless- Talent tree is really fun- Music is wonderful- Combat is fun- Voicing is great- AI is awesome.I love this game!!"
"Ok, the types of games I like the most are RPGs & FPS. The RPGs I have really liked in the past include: Legend of Zelda, Shining Force 1-3, Shadowrun, D&D; Warriors of the Eternal Sun, Lunar 1 & 2, SWTOR 1 & 2, Dragon Age Origins, Mass Effect 1-3 (#2 the most), Icewind Dale, Balders Gate, and others. So I have been playing games for 28 years now.Skyrim:The Good: You get A LOT of play time for your money. Hundreds of hours worth in a single play through and you need to play through twice to experience most of the game. There are some choices tomake in the game that actually do affect the story. It has a good character creator at the beginning of the game with many races to choose from. Some look human, some elves (wood, high/magical, dark), and the reptiles (Argonians), cats (Kajit). There are some characters that you can get as followers. Some you have to do a quest before recruiting them, and others you can permanently hire. You can also marry most followers, and some towns people.There is also crafting of weapons, armor, & magic items. You can pick pockets, locks, burgularize businesses & homes, join guilds & do their questlines, become an assassin, fight dragons, cast many types of spells, use stealth (stealth skills & archery can be very effective). There are many other good aspects about the game, but I try to not spoil anything here.Cons: Wish it was possible to have it be 2 player. Not mmo style or anything like that, just the exact same game with the option of temporarily replacing your follower with a second player, then when they leave have your follower return. That would have been nice.Conclusion: If you like RPGs, you'll most likely want this game. Also if you can only afford 1 game, you will get a lot of play time from this game."
"Review Updated 12/15/2011 after playing 80 hours as an Imperial WarriorWhat an amazing game Skyrim is.  I picked it up not even knowing if I'd like it.  I played Oblivion 5 years late so everything the game was good for was outdated/bad now. The dungeons were awful copypasta, generic setting, story, and you didn't even get to save the world.  Someone else did and he doesn't even live.  It was lame.  The combat was terrible, swords might as well have been inflatable baseball bats or some other nerf toy.  I quickly traded that in for BF3 and it was a great choice for me.Anywho I took a big risk buying Skyrim.  I kept my eyes on this gem right here from the start.  I loved Fallout 3 but the game was extremely buggy and have lost my saves on Fallout 3 about 6 times.  Never picked up New vegas but wanted to.That brings us to Skyrim.  I walked into gamestop, picked it up and it was the last copy.  Usually that's a good sign that you will enjoy the game.  I turned the game on and then I played it all night getting immersed in this rich breathing unique world that Cyrodil failed to do in comparison.  The graphics are some of the best right next to Cryengine 2/3, Frostbite 2 and Gears of war 3 in terms of graphics.  The scopes and vistas are breathtaking and awe inspiring, the combat has alot more oomph to it than previous bethesda games and you can ""feel"" the blows.  The game looks great in HD and sounds great with 7.1 and 7.1 just pulls you in.The music is some of the best I've ever heard in any single player game besides mass effect.  The fights against dragons are epic but on normal difficulty they're fairly easy compared to wooly mammoths, Giants, and maybe centurions.  They're tough but still killable.  The magic is fun to use.  I've never had so much fun ""shouting"" at chickens, shooting lightning and fire at rabbits and accidently killing allies with dragon shouts.Awesome game, some of the best escapist entertainment in the world.  In the game I'm a warrior that can use destruction magic.  When you play this game it really does make you feel like a hero.Don't question it.  Just buy this game.UPDATE IF YOU BUY THIS BEFORE 12/08/11 DO NOT GET THE UPDATE OFF XBOX LIVE 1.2 IS BUGGED EXTREMELY BAD.  PLAY THIS GAME OFFLINE TO AVOID A BUGGY PATCHUpdate 12/15/2011I've ventured 80 hours into Skyrim clearing out about 80 dungeons, got my Daedric Armor, Ebony Bows, level 100 in smithing and Archery and can confidently say it's not getting old.  There seems to be always something new or different you haven't seen yet.  For example you'll be doing a quest and you'll see a fight between a dragon and mammoth and want to glory hound it, or you'll see the northern lights and be mesmerized by it's beauty too much to want to do anything.You see this game is just so rich and unique compared to your common fantasy.  The problem with most fantasy games like wow, guild wars and fable is they all look the same, generic medieval magical forest type of lore.  Now I hate to sound like the COD fanboy of RPGs but Skyrim will be considered the gold standered of RPGs till Fallout 4 which I anticipate.This isn't a game, it's a gift to every person who doesn't have anything going on in life, No girlfriend?  Not enough hours at work?  Unemployed?  Bad Social skills?  Just play this.  It'll keep you busy.What's cool about this game is all your experiences will be 90% different than the other 10-20 million people playing this.  My first night playing Skyrim I remember boldly picking a fight with a giant.  To keep it short I got to touch the big moon ""masser"".It's hard to review this game in detail but I can say if you want to enter a living breathing world and become a hero in it buy this."
"Skyrim hooked me for a good 60 hours. The world is beautiful and the scale is astonishing. That, combined with the ""build the character how you want"" style of advancement was engaging. As the game wore on, though, the fundamentals started to lose me. It's almost MMO-esque in the plethora of indistinguishable fetch quests.Don't get me wrong, there's a lot to do that's very unique and I didn't come close to covering all of the ground offered. I tried to start a new, radically different character, but just couldn't stick with it for very long because it wasn't different enough to distract me from the tedious nature of most quests.Great game and it deserves all the accolades it gets, but I put more time into other RPGs because the storytelling was so much better."
"Skyrim is an amazing game experience that brings the most value to your dollar. I've spent over 70 hours on Skyrim and added over 20 more hours with Dawngaurd. This is a high quality video game.You have many options when creating your character and plenty of opportunities to upgrade your character throughout the game. With Dawngaurd, you are even able to change your face down in the Thieves Guild. I liked the ability to further customize yourself by creating your own armor, whether you want orcish, glass or ebony armor, or a combination of them all.The graphics are stunning. The world you are dropped into is extremely detailed and vivid. I highly recommend walking to some of you're quests, cause you never know what you'll find in the wilderness. The cities are also detailed and there are a few major cities surrounded by many small towns/villages. The voice acting was also great.I think the main quest is a little short, but you'll most likely spend time exploring and completing the side-quest like the Thieves Guild or the Dark Brotherhood. With so many side-quests, you get a very large amount of variety and a reason to come back after you complete the main quest. The dragon fights are epic, but can get a little easy after a while. Dragon battles are still available even after the end of the main quest, by the way.Also, the game was easy to pick-up-and-play. The controls were easy to master, even after taking several months off of playing. The menus were easy to navigate and leveling up was simple. I didn't find it complex at all. Being simple doesn't necessarily mean easy or bad though.As for Dawngaurd, it was a little underwhelming, but I did enjoy it. I followed the vampire quest line which allows you to turn into Vampire Lord; as the vampire lord, you have a new skill tree to level up giving you better skills, of course. You can easily kill enemies with your default Vampire Lord magic though. The story wasn't really deep as you help Lord Harkon eliminate the sun (I won't spoil the rest of the story). Overall, unless you really want a reason to return to your game, I'd say wait for a price drop.Overall, Skyrim is an amazing action-RPG. It gives you more gameplay than most games do nowadays. Dawngaurd was also great, but a little underwhelming. I definitely recommend Skyrim."
"Skyrim is, by far, the best Elder Scrolls game.  Never before have I actually enjoyed making several characters and living out their various play styles.  You can be almost any type of fantasy warrior you can think of, be it a powerful warrior, a skillful mage, a silent assasin, a quick-fingered archer, and anything in between.  The beautiful graphics alone will keep you glued to the screen.  The game gets even better went you download the newest DLC.  It adds in far more than a simple story arc.  This is a must have game!"
"Skyrim is everything an Open World RPG should be. If you've played the previous Elder Scrolls games you'll notice some improvements and changes, but they are all for the better. I was a little worried when I read a preview saying that they had ""simplified"" a lot of aspects of the game, but all the changes are definitely positive. The game is perfect so far...I've played for somewhere around 12-15 hours and I am very, very happy with it. If you are a fan of the ""go anywhere, do anything"" style of game play and you don't like to have to fit your character into a specific mold this game is for you. If you hate fun and amazing video games that will be played for months and years to come I'd recommend skipping this awe-inspiring title."
"Skyrim is many things.Epic.Fun.Engrossing.Flawed.Skyrim is the RPG that won't alienate newcomers and yet it will keep longtime fans pleased as well. Everything from creating your character to spending skill points is extremely fluid and easy to figure out. The combat, while confined to one button per hand, does the job without adding anything too exciting. Where Skyrim truly stands out in my mind is their side quests though.Every single time I would finish a main side quest I would always make the same comment, ""That, in itself, could've been a game's worth of storyline."" Yes, the missions can get repetative and tedious but the end result always had me pleased. Whether I was resurrecting an ailing Brotherhood or fighting in a Civil War, each storyline had me on the edge of my seat, just waiting to see how it all played out.As for the main quest, as epic as it truly is, it's...short. What's worse is that once you finish it, there's little reason to continue your game outside of trying to find and finish every mission. In the grand scheme of things, if you hold off on doing the main stuff till you're good and ready, Skyrim offers up some amazing stuff. Never have I played a game where I actually felt bad about a choice I made. It's not even like that only happened once either, I had multiple moments like that. Likewise, I've never played a game where I got attached to something that should've never amounted to anything more than a pet.SHADOWMERE SAVED MY LIFE MORE THAN ONCE!!!!!!For everything Bethesda did right with Skyrim I can't finish my review without mentioning all the glitches. Three times I ran into game breaking glitches that caused my console to freeze up. That's not including all the other glitches that caused me to lose upwards of 2 hours of gameplay because I got stuck between two rocks. Randomly falling to your death, framerate slowing down so slow that your character may move once every ten seconds, and the complete lack of functionality with the jump button are just a few problems you may run into.Having said that, I've poured more than 60 hours into this game and I'm still finding new stuff to do and weapons to smith. Any game that can say that certainly deserves the attention Skyrim has gotten. Just be aware that there are glitches aplenty."
"Skyrim takes the best of decades of trial and error in video game development, nearly perfects it, and opens the door for the player to inhabit the incredible world they've created.  This is the best video game I've ever played, in my two decades as a gamer.  The graphics and animations are exquisitely rich and detailed, the art style is unique even for the high-fantasy medium, the controls are tight and intuitive, the gameplay is virtually infinite (easily 150 hours), and it is still brimming with a long, strong, and cohesive narrative that brings everything together.  It's not just a technical achievement for Bethesda--it's an endless joy ride for the player.  To me, this is the new standard not just for RPGs, but for video games in general.  Worth every penny, and more."
"The best rpg I've ever played. I've been playing for about a month now and I've not beat it. Spellcasting, weapon weilding, crafting...you have the ability to learn anything without having to choose just one class. Great game."
"The graphics are awesome.  I've had a few moments where I just stopped playing and looked at the scenery of the Northern lights or a sunset.PLENTY of people to talk to and side quests to start up.  Honestly too many in my opinion.  I've been playing every day for weeks now and have barely even started the main quest.  There seems to be a kind of tier with the quests, 1-Main Quest, 2-various guild quests and other semi important ones, 3-the ""Miscellaneous"" quests where you are just going to kill a bandit or something.Leveling is a little off from Oblivion, some skills build naturally and some are advanced with perks that you can choose for special abilities.There are some bugs involved.  My game has frozen up on me three or four times.  Other than that the only ones I've run into are graphic related where someone's arm is in a building or something like that.The big con for me is the fighting system.  You've got a lot of options for weapons and spells and such, but you're using the same two buttons for everything.  It's fine for a while but after dozens of hours of playing it gets a little monotonous when you're just twitching your left and right trigger fingers in order to play the game.  However that hasn't stopped me from playing yet.This game is definitely worth full price."
"The High King has been murdered, the Empire and Skyrim's ""rebels"" are at odds as to how Skyrim should be ruled and is, therefore, tearing the place apart.  What's more, dragons have returned to Skyrim and they aren't anywhere near the realm of kindness for mankind.  Only one person can heal the rift that the world has wrought: the mythical Dragonborn.  Great, I thought, it sounds like the blurb on the back of a crappy fantasy novel.Although there was no original intention of buying this game, after seeing the world gush about it on Facebook and other social networking sites, I decided to give it a go.  It helped that the game was bought as a gift by a friend of mine, the ultimate kind of peer pressure, and so I sat down one night deciding that I'd play for an hour or so just to see what all the hype was about.  My intentions, you should know, was to play for a bit and then return to some other game waiting in a pile, gathering dust, that had been in my possession for much longer than this cryptic game with a dragon emblem standing out in stark contrast to its black background.  You should also know that my intentions meant absolutely nothing after hour one.Over 500 saves and 50 levels later, I've finally completed the game to where I deemed a satisfactory place to end my questing.  The game is, in a word, addicting.  But it's much more than that.  It's fun!  At first I didn't think repeating what would eventually boil down to the same damn quest over and over again would be anywhere near fun, but it is!  Bethesda's brilliance in developing this game was to make most of the quests similar, but many of them just different enough that you get a good laugh, a scare, or an intriguing plot twist that makes you want to continue on.Skyrim, as a place, is believable, vast, and has a wide variety of different locales that make it interesting just to wander around to see what one might find.  The best part about the game is about fifteen minutes in you can leave the main quest storyline and go do whatever the hell you want in this vast land for as long as you want.  The game does not have a shortage of quests and the more you explore the more you will undoubtedly find. You only need to return to the storyline if and when you want to.What's more, is that some of the ""bad"" aspects of the game are actually rather enjoyable.  One of which is the well worn out subject of Skyrim's infamous glitches.  My favorite, personally, was when I was a measly little runt of only a few levels, finding myself in need of some mammoth tusks for a quest.  I, at the time, didn't realize that they could be found elsewhere other than on mammoths.  So, what do I do?  Go and kill mammoths.  Or at least try to.  I failed miserably for a few hours.  I needed only one more!  I happened upon some mammoths with their giant companions and watched as one mammoth shot straight into the air.  Ten seconds later it came back down to earth and although there isn't much in the game that would prompt a mammoth to go sailing through the air in ANY direction, Bethesda apparently decided that if something went sailing through the air long enough, it, no matter what it was, would die.  Or perhaps the one where a horse and rider go flying through the sky ever Westward until my eyes could no longer see them.  The glitches could sometimes get annoying, but general bug fixes have the game working fine now.  Most of the time the glitches had to do with minor happenstance anyway.The only Achilles heel that I see for Skyrim is that yes, a lot of the quests are far too similar.  Plus, after a certain level, the game gets extraordinarily easy.  Although the game does try to keep up with your level by providing harder enemies as you, yourself, become harder to kill, it stops at a certain point.  What with the addictive nature of the quests, most players I've spoken to (including myself) reached a high enough level to surpass even the hardest of targets.However, despite this, the game can only be described as a pure tour de force for Bethesda and the Elder Scrolls series.  It is engaging, a great time killer, and beyond any shadow of a doubt, fun! Something to note, like the Final Fantasy series, the games can be played individually, so no need to get worried about that little ""V"" after ""Elder Scrolls"".Enjoy playing, and don't forget to consume food every so often.  Perhaps a sweet roll."
"There is too much to say about this game, the only word to describe it is perfect. Yes even WITH the bugs...perfect. The music is so amazing and Bethesda really take the time to put in those extra subliminal things that you don't really notice but make the game so much better and realistic. (like the bows) on a ps3 if you're not patient you may find the game ""unplayable"" but my friend who has one and played the game with me for three days straight (only breaking to sleep a few hours) had the lag glitch and still played it for a month till it got fixed. Buy the game, you'll love it."
"This game has so much content and has so much fun stuff to do that no one will have the same experience.games like this should be supported and anybody who hasnt bought this has to because we should be supporting good developers like bethesda, they get better and better which is something other companies cant do. *cough cough* call of duty."
"This game is an absolute blast.  I've completed the main story after about 30 hours, but I still have a ton of content.  There are entire sections of the map I haven't even touched, and I've only explored two or three of the cities and I think there are nine in all, and I'm only level 20, so I've still got tons of levels to earn.  Can't wait to jump back in.  The graphics are beautiful.  There are a lot of different things to do.  The smithing, alchemy, and enchanting add some interesting options for those who like crafting.  You can make almost any type of character you want, a warrior, a mage/thief, assassin, whatever.  Level the skills you want.  I highly recommend this game to rpg fans."
"This game is a ""sandbox"" RPG, where you can go wherever you want, whenever you want. For that reason alone, it gets four stars from me. I love games like this, because you can spend countless hours exploring and getting lost in the virtual world. And the world of Skyrim is BIG! It probably takes over 100 hours to play through all of the quests and explore every map location. All the while, you are becoming more powerful, through the leveling and skill increase system, acquiring better arms, armor and spells.If you are into power leveling, each skill has a way to level it up very rapidly, or you can just do so naturally, by playing the game.I love the skills which allow you to make your own weapons, armor, enchantments, potions, etc. It is possible to craft godly items, like a bow which hits for over 1000 damage (on a sneak attack), a two handed hammer, which hits for over 450, armor that has incredibly powerful enchantments on it, like water breathing, faster mana regeneration, extra hit points, disease immunity, etc.This game outclasses all the previous Elder Scrolls games in every conceivable way, which makes it much more fun and addictive. Random events, such as dragons attacking you while you are shopping in the middle of a town, occur all of the time."
"This game is so much fun, where to begin??? Duel wielding spells, swords, maces or one of each, so many weopons that you can use, upgrade or enchant. Easily explorable world with many missions both main quest and side missions. This game is endlessly fun. An absolute monster of a game with GREAT replay value. If you like long RPG's where you have so much choice in every aspect of the game from weapons, missions, armor, dialogue and so on...........pick up skyrim!!"
"this game was just blew me away from start to finish. Graphics are great, action is good, tons of missions and land to cover. a must buy for any gamer"
"This is a really cool, fun game.  I got it for Christmas and I've been playing it pretty steadily on nights and weekends since then and I don't even think I'm half way through it, this game is huge.Surreal graphics, in-depth story line, a lot of missions and things to explore."
"As I made my way down the slope of a mildly treacherous hillside, there was no inkling in my mind that anything was amiss. I had a pretty good view of the flatlands that lay ahead of me down below and as far as I could tell, there was nothing to either side of me so I was free and clear of any danger. I finally made it to the bottom and maybe thirty, forty steps from the base of the hill, I was thrown into a scene of absolute mayhem.A dragon touched down unexpectedly behind me with a dull thud, creating a cloud of dust with its beating wings. The dust cleared and I looked up at it, merely a few feet away from me, sure I was going to be torn to pieces. Much to my surprise, it wasn't me the damned thing had its attention on. I turned to run and lo and behold, there was another dragon blocking my path, hovering a few feet off of the ground, roaring at the top of its lungs. Apparently they had a couple of things they needed to resolve and I just happened to be trapped in between them. With roars from both, they went at each other and it was in this moment, watching these two giant beasts attack each other in an epic battle that ranged from the earthen floor to the hazy skies above and to the mountain range in the distance that I realized that Skyrim wasn't merely a game. After the two dragons were well away from me, I simply stood there and watched them dance around each other in the sky, their bodies and wings a show of shadowed shapes silhouetted against the hazy sun above.That experience alone was worth not only the price of the game but the price of the console itself.The sheer amount of quests, collectable items and different characters is one thing. Chances are you will not get to see everything the game has to offer because there's just so much to see. The music, the graphics... spectacular. The inventory and leveling up system is a lot better this time around and a lot easier to manage. I played the bejeezus out of Oblivion and as much as I loved that game in particular, this one just takes the cake from it. It makes no sense to me to write you a detailed review. All I can promise you is that this is a game that is absolutely a must play title and will repeatedly show you things that will leave you slack jawed with amazement.  You'll get your money's worth, trust me. Play it however you want, complete missions however you want, join up with whoever you want, rescue anybody you want, etc.I've already sunk dozens of hours into it and I've barely messed around with the main quest. Generally speaking, I've barely scratched the surface of what this game has to offer. There's really not much that I can write that could possibly justify the sheer epic quality of Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim in a few paragraphs. Occasionally, you might find a glitch or two around this world but let's be real folks. It's impossible to create a game of this scope and not have a couple of busted stitches in places. For what it's worth, I could count on one hand the number of programming bugs I've encountered.This is quite simply, adventure done right. Game of the Year for 2011? Nothing else comes close."
"CHeck other reviews for reasons to buy the game.  its a work of art.on the neg,  the drab somber colors are a drag.  I almost bought that assassin game instead just to have  broader color palate.No Kinnect control?  Cmon the menu system sucks.  esp for casting spells.  these need to be hand gestures.the chatbots suck.  the lifeless manequins get dull fast. all the effort went into the surface.  no rendering of personality.  like stick figures.  throw in some variables please.  play mad lib.  if 5 adjectives and five greetings = 25 ways to say a single line.  hearing the same dialoge over and over burns into your brain.limited animation.  again. theres supposed to be 300 hours of gameplay.  but the same thing over and over gets boring. only 1 way to fall off a cliff?  video games are an entertainment medium.  didnt you grow up watching wiley coyote?the music.  why not put some computation into that?  or hire some music school students to provide 300 hours of linear ren fair music to match your gameplay.  the same theme over and over works for a 2 hour movie but not a 300 hour movie."
"For me, Morrowind is still the Elder Scrolls' high water mark; however, Skyrim is honing in on the title. It is obvious that many concessions have been made for console portability but I am playing on XBOX instead of a costly PC these days and feel that the changes work well and make the game accessible to many more people. In Skyrim, the graphics are nothing short of amazing. I find myself looking out at the landscape and just soaking it in. Which brings me to another point, you really get connected with your character in ways that other games can only hope to achieve. This is no hack and slash nor your typical FPS or RPG, it is all of those things plus you  earn degrees/titles, join guilds, make moral decisions and create a real history for yourself. No two characters or play throughs will ever be the same - it is not just the customization of the character but also the overwhelming amount of content that make this possible. Even with the same character, there are 100 ways of approaching any given challenge. Buy this game - it is easily worth the price considering the ridiculous amount of gaming hours that it will provide."
"Got this game the day it came out. I heard so much about it, and love these types of games. But. It just failed completely. There is alot in this game, alot of stuff. However its waaaaay too easy. The computer AI is completely RETARDED! I could take a level 1 archer, and defeat any creature in the whole game very easily. Theres a couple glitches. I mean its hard to be so brutal on a game thats so beautiful. But its just way too easy. No challenge at all. You can up the difficulty but that just increases their health. Its far too easy of a game, and the battle system could definitely be better. Sorry but its the truth.Also. For some reason I lost completely all interest in the game, quests, and story after I finished main missions.Sorry for being so brutal, but dont waste over $30 on this game."
"GOTY . Just like Oblivion bit with better and harder questsThere are alot of reviews that are out there that are better then mine. But I will just say= This game is a five star game. If you have ever player any of the past Elderschroll games this has new great graphics, The quests are just as long but more complex and more indepth. There are alot of puzzles in Skyrim also. But the game is pretty much the same as any Elderschrolls except they added a perk system for every level up for each skill.The only thing I dont like about Skyrim is they took away the reapairing of armor and weapons.IF YOU HAVE NEVER PLAYED ANY ELDER SCHROLLS AND LOVE RPG'S, GET THIS!"
He loves it. He had one and it cracked and he could not use it. It plays wonder4ful in his system. Thank you
I am speechless.This game is by far the best game in the history of video games.The IQ of the developers are definitely extremely high.
"I am the ocassionally player who from time to time, buy a game and play it a little bit till I get bored. Skyrim is the exception since Civilization IV. This game is very well developed and believe me, you won't have enought time to play it."
I don't have anything to add to what everyone else has said.  I'm only writing this because I think this game deserves as many 5 star reviews as possible.  If you liked Oblivion or Fallout 3/New Vegas you should definately buy this game.
"If you want a review there are tons of great reviews for this game, some even perfect scores.  I'm only going to write that this game is the best game I have ever played, period!!"
"I have a mixed review coming for you guys. Basically just because I was told to get rid of the game because I was playing it all day everyday. That is something that takes over your life and you don't want in your life. I immediately began feeling like myself once I threw this in the trash though. I said no thanks. It really is that addictive and if it never ends, watch out. So beware of that when you plan on getting this game. Nonetheless, I was playing as a Rogue type Wood Elf with a crossbow. The items you can get and everything is basically just like any other MMORPG like Diablo II or World of Warcraft. Both those games are extremely addictive as well. If you know how to control yourself, this is the game to get for the 360. I played the computer version at first but quickly got used to this version. The graphics are amazing. Taking down giant trolls is very fun because you can always sneak attack them and they get an arrow right in the back for 3x damage. Either way, the game is incredibly fun and can keep you entertained for hours. There is a reason it's the number 1 seller on Amazon right now. So if you don't get addicted to games easily give it a try. If you do, pass it up. You will thank me later."
"i have played the first oblivion, redneck redemption, and fallout. none of them kept my interst due to the combat system. this game is a blast. i am a linear player (i loved the wolfenstein franchise) but i dont mind skipping from side mission to side mission. i find the menu system intuitive and fun. finally, a sandbox i love to play!"
"Ill sum this up... This game is better than MorrowWind...  Great graphics, controls, story, quests.... and fun...  I have to save every now and then because I die a bunch, and that means the game is good. Definitely learn the pickpocket skill, as it will help you trememdously (ie, have someone train you, then just pickpocket the money you just gave them back to you, and repeat 4 more times)."
I mean everyone else has said it all on amazon.  It is game of the year for sure nothing wrong with this game I was a fable fan and this was my first elder scroll game And I have to say it was nothing short of amazing their are so many different things to do hours and hours of fun.  I think I might even like this more than fable.  It is an all around great game!
"I'm not a big RPG fan. I bought Oblivion when it came out and didn't like it. I'm generally not an RPG fan of any kind aside from Mass Effect, N6$ Zelda games, and Final Fantasy 7 - that's it. All of my friends at work were saying what a great game this is and I took a $60 gamble and picked it up. It sat on my shelf until I got tired of playing nothing but Modern Warfare 3 for a couple of months.I finally got around to playing it and I have been seriously impressed with this game. The story is fantastic and the visuals are some of the best I have seen on my Xbox 360, The audio quality is one of the most impressive things. I play this game with my Turtle Beach EarForce X-31's and the ambient audio alone suprises me every time I play.The amount of content and options on how the game is pretty staggering. Unlike Oblivion this game will actually give you direction. You can derail from the main quest at any point in time but you are routinely pushed back into the main quest regardless of what path you are taking.There are plenty of more well thought out reviews from IGN and GamesRadar etc; from the perspective of a guy who usually doesn't like RPG's at all I highly advise picking this game up. I normally just play Call of Duty but can't seem to take myself away from this game. It is an extremely rewarding experience. It is easily one of the best, if not THE best games, that I have played on this console generation."
"I'm not gonna waste time describing this masterpiece since hundreds more detailed reviews exist covering that. I have to take my hat off and proudly say this is the finest video game I have ever played in my life. The golden memories of my brothers and I playing The Legend of Zelda on the NES back in 1987 have returned to me in my age of 29 with Skyrim, something I was sure I wasn't gonna experience ever again in this life...it almost makes me cry. Go ahead call me a wuss, I don't care I'll be lost in Skyrim for the next few months if not years."
"I'm tired of killing crypt zombies and bandits! One catacomb after another. Another meaningless bandit fort. Lets conquer another dwarven ruin that takes 4 hours to get through. Alright...I'm officially insane now.Really: follow a talking dog 5 miles, only to have to have to run halfway across the map 2 times, just to get some weapon that I don't even use. That's a quest?I really did enjoy breaking into every single house in the city and taking everything (I mean everything). Baskets, apples, plates, bowls, everything! Until I couldn't carry anything else, and then going back for more. Everything I stole, I dropped in the middle of the street. Soon, houses were vacant, and the streets were full of so much miscellaneous junk that it was like walking through a garbage dump. Kicking things around and literally wading through piles of useless items in the middle of the city street. Clinking noises when I walk. Eventually I had to go back and pick everything back up (which took a considerable amount of time) because the game was going in slow motion. baskets flying through the air in slow motion, bouncing off of NPC's heads. Fun fun. It does the same thing if your house is too full of alchemic agents also. Or if you kill to many of your A.I. travel buddies in your dining room. Or decorate your house with piles of bones and skulls allover the floor until your kicking bones across the living room.If I was doing all these things, then I must of been bored, right? Maybe, and maybe not. Hey...getting your telekinetic ability up by throwing baskets at people can be a good time. Don't you think?"
"I personally thought the game didn't fully deliver what it's creators were promising us. It suffers from a lot of glitches and bugs, and it doesn't look as marvelous as they made it out to be. It's riddled with plenty of fetch quests which ruins the good quests and dungeons. It's still a good game with a grand atmosphere. You'll be exploring for quite a long time before you start to get bored of the game. Although I don't use the physical map (came with the pre-order of this game), I didn't find it to be high quality as I expected (I expected more of a nice cloth texture to it). But that doesn't really matter. The game is good, but not perfect."
"ive been playing since it came out (i had a release date delivery) and its the BEST game EVER... for me. ive played oblivion and played over 200 hours. this game is so perfect i cant stop playing !! its just so awsome. if you like rpg, open world, do what you want type games get Skyrim it the best game of its kind"
"I won't waste words here. If you love lush artwork, excellent graphics, wonderful stories, and lots of fun and very violent game play, then this game is for you! It's improved on all the elements of Bethesda's previous issues but left the best elements unchanged. Great, great game!!!!!"
"Just want to say if you have been putting off buying this game due to cost. You can get it at Newegg.com for $36.99 NEW right now. That is the current cost to buy it used in many places. Best part, it is Newegg so you know it is fast shipping.As far as a review. This is a great game and well worth the money. I recommend it to just about anyone who likes a good RPG and Adventure type game."
"Let me start off saying that the game is much better than even people expected. There is so much content, that it became overwhelming. Since its already been pretty late from the release of Skyrim I probably put about 1000 hours into containing several characters. The time you can spend on the game is very high because of the amount of characters you can create. An example of one would be that I had a character who wore heavy armor, carried two-handed swords, and was great with smithing. You can even do someone who is a powerful mage with a good one-handed sword and high alchemy or no alchemy. The choice is truly up to you.I may put an 1000 hours if I ever have the time."
"My hopes were very high for Skyrim. I'm happy to say that it has surpassed all my expectations of the Elder Scrolls series. The impressive scenery, combat system, and even the menu. Just awesome. I would highly recommend this to anyone."
"My only complaints are the lack varied types of enemies. after a few hours you know exactly what to expect from each type of dungeon you enter. some more variety would be nice. My other primary complaint was continuously snowy landscape that brought back horrid memories of the frozen wasteland that i escaped from in joining the military. still that cant be helped as Skyrim is a snow covered land, im just hoping the next title takes place somewhere more tropical.on the Good side, the sheer size and scope of the game is amazing. i wasnt even into the 3rd part of the primary quest before i had dozens of side quests or story lines to follow. There is a HUGE world to discover, even more expansive than Oblivion and i enjoyed the leveling system as well, though it did seem to remove some amount of strategy from leveling IMO.I also wish that they would go back in time and remove the censorship from the game, not because im desperate to see naked elf-girls, but because your female companions turning into male were-wolves is a little odd IMO. The first elder scrolls titles were not afraid to show a few boobs and i think they should go back to that. it need not be done in an erotic way but can be done tastefully and naturally."
"Not the game of the year this is the game of the decade, countless hours of fun. The best RPG if not the best game of any kind ever made. 5/5."
Skyrim is an amazing RPG. Im probley 10-12 hours into it and have done like 4 main quests. This game makes you want to go off and do other side quests and explore the amazing world that is Skyrim. If your not a huge RPG fan please try this game out and you might change your mind. A great investment and will give you over 100 hours of gameplay.
"Skyrim is my favorite game of all time.  Awesome story, music, graphics, and lore.  Simple but fun gameplay.  Excellent leveling and inventory system.  Great DLCs.  Tryhards and hipsters should avoid this game, but if you want to lose yourself in an interesting and beautiful world, you should try this game."
Strange to be in a room of NPC's and 2 or 3 are speaking in the same voice. It would have been nice had they hired a few more voice actors or hired actors capable of more than just a monotone drone. There are a few bugs along the way but it is a humungous world and you'll probably run out of quests before exploring it all.
The best game i have ever played!Thats all i do at least 15 hours a day! my charactor is finally starting to be a tough one through my wise choice of spending my perk points properly early on in the game.
"There are all ready so many reviews I feel a little obsolete doing this, but I thought that I would give Skyrim the praise it deserves.First of all, yes there are bugs.  Lot's of them.  I held off on this review for so long because 1- I wanted to give Bethesda some time to fix the bugs and 2- Reviews after having played only 4 hours aren't even worth reading.  As such THERE ARE STILL BUGS.  I haven't noted any game-breaking ones, but some of the minor ones still exist like weapons hanging in mid-air, dragon skeletons that seem to follow you around, and other non-descript things.  Then there are the ones that make me give the current edition a 4.5/5 like Jarls not giving me a houscarl after promising me one, game freezes, or really long load times.If these problems are fixed then I am more than happy to give it the full 5/5.Besides those glitches and bugs, I think this game is awesome.  Graphics are great, the audio is superb, and the open world-rpg-customization is just my favorite type of game.Some of the new skills are particularly satisying such as the blacksmithing.  I love the fallout 3 style perks they have added (winks at the decapitation perk) and the randomly generated quests that keep popping up.The game feels improved over oblivion and fallout in every way.  (Thanks so much Bethesda for getting rid of the npc's that would stop time and stare at you with their baby-faces everytime you talked to them).Pratically everything that I could say has already been covered in other reviews, so let it suffice me to say that it is honestly the funnest game I have ever played.  I have played over 100 hours and am looking forawrd to the next 100.  I highly recommend it."
There are the usual Bethesda bugs but nothing game breaking so far.  Can't wait to drop a couple hundred hours in this game.  Very beautiful.
"The size and how much there is in this game just amazes me. Who cares about a little bugs here and there, you always come across something in the game that makes you forget all of that stuff. I would gladly pay $60 anytime for this game."
"This game is amazing.  It took everything that was great from Oblivion and added to it.  It has a more mature feel and is just downright spooky at times.  There isn't a whole lot that can be said that hasn't been already, so I will focus my review on the 2-3 things that bother me about this game.  They don't really affect the game negatively all that much, but improvements could be made in the future.  In an attempt to not spoil anything, I will try to give only vague examples of what I don't care for.  I do not like how NPC's attitudes towards you don't change based on what has already occurred.  For example, I have beat the ""mages guild"" quest yet many within the college still talk down to me as if I'm some new recruit that is on the way out.  It is one thing to give me a lesser task as a quest that I didn't take the time to do earlier, but to speak to me in a disrespectful fashion just makes me mad IRL.  Another example - there is a group of rebels that has a number of camps set up in a certain area of the map.  I made great sacrifices to save their leader, yet I can't go within a reasonable distance from these camps without 50 of them charging at me with swords drawn.  Kind of annoying.  So that is one thing I think Bethesda could certainly improve upon.  Secondly, I do not like how you are unable to turn down many quests.  There are some that frankly I just don't want anything to do with.  I like to play as ""the good guy"" but I am also OCD in that I do not like to see quests that I have been given go undone.  I was forced to do the bidding of a Daedric lord simply because I walked into a certain house.  I now have a quest that has something to do with eating the flesh of dead bodies even though I specifically told the person ""I want nothing to do with this"".  Now the only way I can get rid of this quest is to go and meet this person and who knows what happens then.  It would just be nice if there were different routes one could take to accomplish these side quests.  It would be cool if I could go to the authorities and put an end to this flesh-eating person's deeds, but instead I have to go and potentially take part in it just so I can remove it from my active quests."
This game is a must buy for everyone!! It has the best graphics game!!! The world is huuuuuuuge and the game is truly entertaining until its end (which is also a very looong game).I do love it and i will keep it as my collectionable even.
"this game is intensive and once you get into it, it takes up hours and hours of day and night time. I have lots of hours, But, if you don't have the book, then you will need a online computer to get the information. I use my laptop a lot! and keep it accessible while playing, cause there is a lot of things you need to know that the game just doesn't give.The buy/build a house is cool and you had better be ready to have a huge amounnt of Iron bars or orre, cause building a house, wow! a lot of Iron and wood.Beware of becoming a Vampire or a Werewolf - I have one character that I have been a Vampire almost since i started it, and getting rid of it, within the first 3 days can be cured cheaply! Easy. But if you are like me who had no clue - well i have about 90 Plus days in and, grrrrrrr! As long as you bite the neck of a sleeping person every night, you'll be fine. after 4 days and everyone wants to kill you, this is the part of the game that is wrong, becasue they know you are coming long before you see them or the town.You don't regain anything until night, your blood boils. Oh, and if you build a house, you can also put a Casket in the basement -"
this game is soo amazing but  without you noticing hours will fly its really funawesome the fighting is much better then oblivion and more gore and bloodthey fixed most of the glitchs in the gamethis game is so fun i beat it twicethe magic is much more control ablethe world is quite detailed and the sky is very nice
this game is the best elder scrolls ever i love it!!!! so why dont you all go pick this one up
"This is easily one of the greatest RPGs I have ever played. The fantasy world is so convincing and immersive that minutes in real life turn into hours it seems. The story, play-control, music, trade-skills, and NPC interaction are all well done. This now sets the bar for what I now expect when I pay $50-60 for a game. I have put enough hours into it to already beat most games twice by now, yet I have barely begun to scratch the surface.5-stars, perfect game to enjoy for the winter holidays."
This is one of the most entertaining games i have ever played. You can play this for a hundred hours and not beat it by a long shot! I hate games that have super short storylines and overall gameplay. You should definetley buy this game.
This is probably the first time I gave a four to five rating on any game in a while and I have to say that Skyrim was not at the top of my gaming list this year. But I picked it up looking to kill some time and I have to say that I have been losing CHUNKS of it cause of this game and I still feel like I have not even Touched the surface of this game. There is just SO much to do and seeing how ALOT of play throughs just to see something different happen then from your original play through can be and what affect it has on the world around you. By no means do I work for or getting paid to praise this game from the company but this title is really worth putting down CODMW3 to give it shot this year. I'm glad that I did get this game or else I would have missed out. And this is my first Elder scrolls title and now I'm looking forward to getting into the rest of the Elder scrolls titles just to see the rest of the storyline and why its so popular other then being a major time killer. Trust me get this title before the DLC starts to come out.
"This is the biggest, most beautiful, and addicting game I have ever played. The character development is very deep, the storyline is unique and amazing. You can literally play this game for hundreds of hours and never get bored. This is the best game of the last 5 years and if you don't have it, get it now."
"WOW, the graphics are amazing. I could get into all the details why a Elder Scrolls game blows my mind but i wont. Its a 10 out of 10 in my book for what it is. The only problem i have with it is compared to Morrowwind this series is getting dumbed down, but all games are. Skyrim will waste hundreds of hours of my life and i will let it and enjoy letting it."
"great game, got it for the 360. Have 50-60 hours in it already, beat the game a couple of weeks ago. Cant wait till DLC comes out. Im one of those guys who are highly against DLCs, because i come from the days of mods on the PC. But Ive switched to the consoles, and i wouldn't mind getting a DLC to continue my experience in this game. Of course, this game is on the PC and modable, but my PC sucks. Soon i will build a good PC and repurchase this game for it, just to play all the amazing mods the community has been making."
"If I had to peg my review or my opinion of this game I would say that it is towards the bottom of the scale, but still in the 4-star range.  I loved Oblivion but for some reason that game seemed to move a lot faster than Skyrim.  I have put about 6 hours into the game so far and of course am only at the beginning I suppose, but wanted to weigh in.  I do like the graphics overall but honestly think they could be just a tad sharper.  I heard you could be married to like 100 or more women in the game, which to me is ridiculous at any stretch of the mind.  I think that aspect of the game would have been much sharper if you were limited to 3 or something.  It basically now is about as deep as deciding if you are going to pick up a dang linen cloth or carrot or something along those lines.  I also think when you decide to steal that your hands should move rather than the stuff just magically disappearing into your body.  That is sort of cheap because it would not have been that hard to add that into the game.  These are small things that I mention but add up, and when you add them up you can see that there are some flaws in the game.  Overall I am not totally blown away.  I will probably play this for another 10 hours or so and trade it in."
"If you liked Oblivion: the elder scrolls, you'll LOVE this game.  That's all that needs be said.Everything is upgraded to current standards of technology, so it comes across very well."
"This game is awesome.  It has all the good things about oblivion, like ability to fight with weapons and cast magic.  It has also improved a lot since Oblivion.  The graphics are much  better, and you really feel immersed in the story.  You get to fight dragons, cast spells, use weapons, practice espionage and all sorts of fun stuff.  If you have a job/are in school/have a family, there will never be enough time to do EVERYTHING, but you can still get through the main storyline and have a blast.  Buy it today!"
This is the type of game you play and lose yourself in! The type of game where you are addicted to it and forget about your real life haha (which you should moderate your game time cause you will be locked in your room forever!!! ) This Game Is the BEST RPG FANTASY GAME EVER!!! Oblivion was amazing but with no more Dumb Oblivion gates popping up everywhere and more options on just about everything this game surpasses is it!! 100% Pure Fun Fantasy
"To anyone who played The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion, you would know that there were XP rewards for completing main quests and quests overall.  That is not the case in Skyrim.  I am currently halfway through the  game with over 30+hours and 400+ kills and I am level 7, yet I see videos of people on youtube who are in the 30's and 40's.Either my game is glitched (I'm playing with the latest title update, so I highly doubt that) or the leveling system is just flawed and the people on youtube found a way to boost.The best way I can tell anyone to level up is to fight.  However I have specifically declined companion help and took charge in missions that had others fight by my side so I could get the kills.  It does not seem to help.There is a very simple gold exploit for people looking for quick gold. Go to Riften and the temple of mara there, talk to Maramel and buy the amulet of mara, put it on. Go back to whiterun and the inn there and find a woman namde Uthgerd, talk to her and accept here CQC challenge, beat her and she will marry you, after that, she will give you 100gold every ingame 24 hours (25 real life seconds if you wait) and it will continue to work over and over again and stack (I've let it go to $9,900 just to be safe)Other than those issues, and the texture loading issues, skyrim is great, probably GOTY."
"This is the Perfect game for any RPG gamer. Its a amazing game even if you have not played Oblivion! i Picked this up at Gamestop and its worth every penny! Has some long play time too, it gets really involved."
"Bethesda's Skyrim on the X-Box is Big, Beautiful, Balanced and Bugged.  The world designers deserve the very highest marks for making such a huge and not repetitive world.  There are a few places where you will see the same architecture used but by and large each area is fantastically unique.  You will find yourself wondering just how many people were on the design team in order to make each area fell so wildly different.  The world plays much better than Fallout because there are so many places to explore and the travel between locations is relatively fast.  Nasty load and getting stuck bugs from Fallout are nearly gone.  My son and I have played totally different character builds and both work extremely well.  So, unlike Elder Scrolls 4, which had some builds that worked very well while others failed, this game is exceptionally well balanced.The down side is the number of bugs in the quests that result in your inventory being full of useless items.  There are an incredible number of quests and relatively few problems but they are significant.  For example, there is a quest where you kill somebody and get a sword which leads to the next step.  For whatever reason, the quest was not marked as complete for me and the guy who drops the sword is also needed to get his heart.  In trying to get the heart later I now have 3 copies of the sword filling up my inventory and a heart that I found elsewhere but I can't finish the quests. So, I have LARGE amount of my inventory full of items that I can't get rid of and I can't clear the quest.  In other places, I found items before I got assigned the quest.  So, again extra junk in the inventory.  In other quests I killed the required boss before the quest and the quest arrow leads to the place where the now decomposed body was.  Again, that leads to some items stuck in my inventory.  Other places, I found items, before they were requested, got credit for the quest but the items are in my inventory.You got the idea the inventory management and quest bugs stink and happen over and over again.So, there is one major design flaw in an otherwise truly awesome game."
"Game overall is great, but be sure to save often. It's not uncommon to get stuck in a position where you can't get out (in a rock formation or under a staircase), or to walk off the edge of a ""cliff"" which was just seconds ago a flat piece of terrain. The latter is really odd, it's like you turn around then turn back and all of a sudden you see a bunch of lines and wireframes in place of a city street or open plain.You can play forever though, well worth the money."
"Great Game! One of the best all-time! Everyone who is a fan of RPGs and Oblivion need to get this game, you will not be disappointed."
"I buy roleplaying games primarily for the story, and where that is concerned, I've never seen better than Skyrim.  The side quests are as full and rich as the main story in other games.  There is a lot of content here, with excellent voice acting.  The graphics are great, and the skill mechanics are very good.  I like that skills improve with use, and not just at leveling time as with other games.My only issue is that the combat was very unbalanced, at least for the characters I played:  a stealthy thief archer and a mage.  I'm not a hardcore gamer, but I put myself in the experienced casual category.  I buy 3 or 4 games a year, and play several shooters on the highest difficulty setting.  With Skyrim I had to dial down the difficulty to novice to avoid getting killed with one hit, but then that made the dragon encounters way too easy, and yet some of the falmer encounters were still way too difficult for routine dungeon crawls.  The game seems to be balanced for the heavily armored, or at least the heavily potioned.  Keep that in mind if you prefer light, stealthy, and agile characters."
"I cannot even find a word in any dictionary available to describe the epicness of this game. That's how great it is.I began my play-though of Skyrim as a noob to Elder Scrolls. I knew nothing of the series nor did I play any of the prior games. I was amazed by the depth of this game. The combat system, the leveling up system, the glorious open-world freedom, the sheer amount of quest, how easily I can immerse myself in Skyrim, the uniqueness of the Dragonborn storyline, the incredible graphics, the bards... I could go on for days. Really. It all was impeccable.I have never played anything so well crafted, so polished, in my entirety of gaming. It's not just a game, it is a piece of art. I cannot even count the amount of epic moments in this game. My favorite is, most definitely, the last main quest.I cannot put my controller down. I have finished the main quest-line but I am striving to only stop playing when I have felt my business in Skyrim is finished. Which is saying a lot because I have logged over 80 hours and I am STILL not finished with Skyrim.This super-epic masterpiece of a game's pros make you completely disregard its cons. However, as a thorough reviewer I must mention them. For me I would have liked to see some of the dialogue get more depth. Sometimes I felt like, to some characters, more could have been said. Another thing I want to touch on is the seemingly lack of voice actors. Yes, I do realize Skyrim is large game and has many characters, but still... I did get a little irked hearing the same voice for several different people. There were some minor bugs that I encountered. Other than that this game was utter perfection.With all that being said, I wholeheartedly believe TEV: Skyrim deserves a perfect five out of five. The pros FUS RO DAH the cons away with an Unrelenting Force."
"If you have not played Skyrim yet and you love RPG / Action games, then you are missing out on the best game of year by far.  Skyrim took what Oblivion did so well and expanded on it, while taking out the repetitiveness found in Oblivion after you close a few gates.  The graphics are great, the stories and quests are as enjoyable as ever, and the music and audio is top notch.  The only bad thing I have noticed is that any companions you pick up on the way are pretty much one dimensional, great for holding your extra inventory, but mostly pointless beyond that."
"I have been playing this game since release date and enjoy every aspect of the game.  I am a level 48 and don't think I have scratched the surface of this game.  I set out on a mission and get side tracked with chasing down a dragon or trying to get over the next mountain.  I have found loot on top of mountains that I couldn't find again if I tried. The music score, the game sounds and the voice acting has been great.  I am blown away by the visuals.  If you liked Morrowind and Oblivion you won't be disappointed with Skyrim as it truly has been a pleasure to play."
"I love this game.  It sucks you in and you will remember the game all your life.  For how much time they spent on this game and with all the other games they have done you would think they would have made the combat a little better by now.  The kill animations are pretty corny and terribly done.  The main story line is very very short.  This was a major disappointment for me.  After I beat the main quest I was like, ""WTF..that's it?"".  Luckily as usual there are a ton of side quests.  Overall I think they could have done a better job."
"I love this game.  Love it!  It is near perfect.  The problems that I have with this game are far outweighed by the grand scale and endless things to do in game. The monotony of Oblivion leveling that constantly scaled enemies to your level are gone. You really have some uncertain battles that you may not make it out of, making you think and plan out battles.  The amount of player customization is also amazing.  You want to be a wizard/fighter....done, you just want to pickpocket all the time....done. Go anywhere, do anything!!! I found myself having a blast just kicking in bandit forts and gathering loot. Also, this game is beautiful. It really has to be seen to be appreciated. There really are some jaw dropping moments.My only complaint with the game is this:It is way to easy! Sure there are some battles that you may have to plan for but most enemies do not require that much effort(most of the time). Dragons especially are way to easy.  You imagine them to be the most fearsome opponents, where you have to flee most of the time, but no, most of them are so weak it is laughable. I think this game could have done with some more puzzles as well to round out the combat and the thinkers among us. Maybe some more intricate dungeons.For next one, or expansion, I think they need to open up the monsters manual and really get some scarey stuff for us to kill.  I am thinking Medusas, Hydras, displacer beasts, more demons, manticores, and bugbears.  I know its like asking for a third helping of ice cream, but its a suggestion.These complaints may seem harsh, but fret not, this game is amazing and so full of fun, you may forget about the world for a few months. This game is near perfect. I just hope with the next expansion pack they make things more difficult."
"I'm calling it right now. This game surpassed all of my expectations for the title. I played Morrowind and devoted countless hours into Oblivion. It's the gift that keeps on giving. Screw this review, I'm going to go play some more!"
"I picked up Oblivion back in 2007 not knowing quite what to expect.  It was my first Elder Scrolls game, and although I had heard that the series was very time-intensive, I was quickly overwhelmed at the sheer number of possibilities.  As a completionist, I quickly got nowhere and gave up on the game after only around a dozen hours of gameplay.  For those who are in the same boat and are considering Skyrim, I would recommend giving the series another chance.  I've approached the game differently this time around, trying my best to negate the effects of my ADD.  With a more focused approach I've been able get into and appreciate this game.  The sheer scale of everything is, once again, daunting.  However, with objectives fairly clearly laid out, I've had a much easier time navigating the landscape.  There are numerous memorable experiences.  Namely dragon attacks, which are awesome when you're in a group, then terrifying when you're alone.  Everything is customizable.  Everything is explorable.  That mountain you've walked by 20 times?  There's a cave entrance above you on some path that you never saw.  The dungeon crawling is varied enough so that I haven't gotten bored yet.  I've stumbled into enormous compounds on side-quests (picking up necessary story-related items unintentionally...  BTW, if it looks important, it is!!!), and happily discovered shorter jaunts on what I expected to be grueling, multi-hour long quests.  The game so far has provided many surprises, all of them good.  It isn't quite as polished as, say, Red Dead Redemption (which I am constantly reminded of for some reason), but the scale and scope of the game make some buginess acceptable.  If you're into RPGs even somewhat, I would recommend giving this incredible game a try."
"It's exceedingly rare these days for me to become immersed in an RPG in such a way that demands, and keeps my attention longer than an hour or so. This game does this and more. It's fun, beautiful, engrossing, and has just a wonderfully exciting story. The only other game that has grabbed my attention in such away would be Mass Effect. Even if you're not an avid RPG gamer, you should at least give this one a rent."
"I've played MANY games over the past three decades...and I have to say that Skyrim might be one of the greatest games (if not the greatest) ever crafted.  This is truly a gaming masterpiece by Bethesda, and I've never savored a game as I am doing with this one."
"I've put in about 15 hours with Skyrim now, and I just got past the ""Oh wow"" stage, where every new environment and every new encounter (in town or in battle) left me in a state of awe, wondering aloud how such a miraculous game world could exist in the same generation as the other excellent (but by comparison, severely dated) RPGs Bethesda has put out recently. The world of Skyrim is lush, detailed, and jam packed with content (I don't know exactly HOW much larger the world is than Oblivion or Fallout, but the answer lies somewhere close to ""a lot""). You never feel like an area is just filler to pad the map, and unexpected encounters with bandits, animals, giants, and yes, dragons, are guaranteed.  The way in which you interact with this world is far more organic than previous games as well. Time does not stop when you talk to people, there is no static zoom in shot of their face as you go through dialogue options, and the horrific ""wheel of persuasion"" from Oblivion has been thankfully put out to pasture. NPCs also follow much more realistic daily routines, and will interact with each other whether you are there or not.  One particularly nice moment had me traipsing through the wilderness and stumbling across a group of Dominion elves ambushing some Nordic rebels in a pitched battle that they warned me to steer clear of (obviously, I did not). The whole feel of the world is natural and the interface intuitive (oh, bless that new menu system!) making this the most immersive gaming experience I have ever had.Leveling is handled so well in Skyrim that you won't even notice it. There are no static stats to pad or class roles to adhere to. You will simply get better at skills that you actually use, and as you level you can add perks to those skill trees depending on how often you use them. This means not only that a myriad different play styles are available (indeed this is a staple of Bethesda's RPGs) but that each one will be fluid and adaptable through the entire game, and you will feel the difference between a brawler, a sneak, a mage, etc like never before. And yes, it is FINALLY viable to be a straight caster in Skyrim, thanks to a much improved spell system. In fact, after years of playing as burly Nords or stealthy elven archers, I am rolling as a full on mage that carries no weapon of any kind, and combining destruction, restoration, and conjuration is an absolute dream.Now, as I said at the top, I am past the ""wow"" stage with Skyrim. Well, mostly. I stumbled upon my first onset of frustration with the game due to some typical Elder Scrolls problems cropping up in - where else? - a Dwemer ruin. First of all, the dungeons on the whole in Skyrim are 1000% better than in Oblivion. Each one feels unique and vibrant in a way that the random tunnels in Oblivion never did (ugh, Oblivion Portal flashback). That being said, my first Dwemer encounter had me flashing back to Morrowind, where you could spend literally 2 hours in one dungeon searching for what was ultimately a pretty uninspiring final room, which only 3 or so different types of enemies spread thinly through the dozens of rooms. Also, the tight corridors coupled with a few spots of enemy crowding shine a light on how imprecise the combat system can still be at times. You can get trapped between characters, stuck on geometry, and after single-handedly bring down several dragons in the open it is still possible to get cornered and wrecked by an acid-spitting bug. At the end of the day, however, if this is the worst thing that Skyrim can throw at me, I won't mind putting in another 100 hours or so.Many have commented on the ""favorites"" menu replacing the old hot-key wheel from Oblivion. I have to say that, on the whole, I love this new pop up interface, which pauses the action without having to go into the menu system.  It can be cumbersome for spell casters that need to switch between half a dozen spells regularly, but it will not be an issue for other play styles and if I have to take this with the elegant overall menu structure of the game, I will take it. Menus are quick and responsive, never laggy, at least for me (I have it installed on my 360, which also cuts down on the load times). Bugs are also at a minimum now that Bethesda has released two post-release patches to the game.There are probably dozens of other things I could gush about, but who needs ANOTHER two-page love letter to this game? The bottom line is, if you love Bethesda's other RPGs, you already have this game and are just looking for someone to agree or argue with here. If you've never played any of the company's previous efforts, this is a great place to start, as it is the most beautiful, most exciting and by far the most accessible game in the series to date.Game of the Year. No contest."
"I wasn't really into Western RPGs until I tried Fallout 3.  After losing 200+ hours of my time playing in the Wasteland of Fallout, I tried Fallout: New Vegas.  I was dissapointed with New Vegas, because even though it had all the basic elements of Fallout 3, it felt more like a large expansion than an truly new game.  Then a friend convinced me to play Bethesda's previous game, Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion.  I enjoyed Oblivion, but I couldn't get over the outdated graphics and ugly character models.  When I saw the trailers for Skyrim, I was very excited.  The graphics looked awesome, the characters seemed more alive and better animated, and the gameplay looked more refined.  I was a little worried because there were talks of streamlining the RPG elements, and usually that equates to dumbed down gameplay, and also Bethesda is notorious for having buggy games.  Fortunately, this isn't the case in Skyrim.If you haven't played an Elder Scrolls game before, the basic concept is you can be whoever you want to be.  This means total freedom, from what race you want to play, what type of combat and skills you want, and where you want to go and do.  There is a main story quest, which will take about 20-25 hours to complete, but it's completely optional.  The great thing about Skyrim is that if all you want to do is slay monsters and be the hero, the game has that.  But if you want to get jobs, make money, buy a house, get married, and live out a virtual life, you can do that too.  The game doesn't have an end, and it's completely non-linear.The game plays from a first person perspective, so anyone familiar with FPS games should have no problem figuring out the controls.  The combat feels more natural than Oblivion, but it isn't perfect.  There are still times where you feel like your sword is slicing through thin air even though you're hitting enemies.  The hit zone on enemies is pretty generous, so even though combat isn't as visceral as it could have been, it isn't an excercise in frustration like Dead Island.  Using arrows and magic is easy, and the aim is pretty accurate.  Even at low levels, your skills as a gamer have more impact on your aim than your character's stats.The graphics are really good.  They aren't Crysis 2 good, but then nothing is, except Crysis 2.  Anyway, it can easily stand among the best looking Xbox 360 games.  There are plenty of times where you'll be exploring the snow capped mountain ranges of Skyrim, and you'll just have to stop and admire the beautiful scenery.  Character models are a big improvement over Oblivion and Fallout 3, although they still look a tad creepy.  Conversations are more natural, and the game no longer pauses and zooms into character's faces when you talk to them.  The animations are pretty good, but still a bit stiff at times.  Nothing too distracting, but hopefully the next Elder Scrolls game will be better.  My biggest complaint with Oblivion was the graphics, so I'm really glad Skyrim is a huge improvement and much easier on the eyes.The sound is impressive in Skyrim.  One of the best aspects of Skyrim is easily the musical score.  It is simply one of the best game soundtracks ever composed.  The voice acting is pretty good, though on some rare occasions the voices are a tad weird.  The sound effects are good, and most sound natural.  When you're dealing with a Fantasy game like Skyrim, all of the sounds should sound like things you'd hear in real life.  For the most part, they do, but occasionally there are sounds that sound more ""video game"" than ""real life"".Story in Skyrim is what you make of it.  The main storyline is well crafted, but some of the side missoins can feel a little underwhelming.  The strange thing about an open world RPG like Skyrim is that the best stories, the ones that you tell your friends and remember for a long time after you're done playing, are the stories that you make by playing the game your way.  When you find a path off the beaten trail, come across a river and see a deer drinking on the other side, so you draw your bow in hopes of making a kill, when a giant spider jumps out of nowhere and chases the deer across a field and into the woods.  You give chase, running into the woods after them.  You fire an arrow into the spider's rear end, and it turns it's attention to you, spitting poison in your face.  Using a combination of fire magic and a sword, you slay the spider, and loot it's corpse.  Then you notice a bloody skeleton mounted on a wooden stake, and a little farther ahead a cave.  You explore the cave, and inside you find undead monsters guarding a long lost weapon of great power.  You claim the weapon for yourself, and now every time you draw that weapon, you think about that deer drinking water.  It's those unscripted moments that are truly memorable, because you made them your own.I mentioned earlier the bugs Bethesda is infamous for, and Skyrim is no exception.  My first time loading up the game, instead of the beginning sequence playing out, the characters just stood there and nothing happened.  I was forced to reset my game, but since then I've played about 60 hours and haven't encountered a single bug or glitch.  I've heard some people complain of bugs, but I personally haven't had any (besides the first), and none of my friends who play the game have had any either.  It seems more stable that previous Bethesda games, so don't let the possibility of bugs sway you from playing this excellent game.This game can be whatever you want it to be.  If you just want to play the main quest, there's nothing forcing you to play side quests.  But if you want to get the most from Skyrim, you can go out exploring every cave, reading every book, talking to every NPC, trying every potion, crafting every weapon, and losing yourself in the massive, endless world of Skyrim."
"I wouldn't be surprised if this game got GAME OF THE YEAR. Countless hours and quests, endless options, great surprises...Highly recommended."
"Just played for about 5 hours and I really like this game.  It's as good as oblivion, actually even better.  Highly recommended."
"Love, love, love this game. The direction pad control functions related to changing what's in your hands isn't very user-friendly or intuitive, but that's about my only complaint."
"Never being able to get into most Bethesda games, I was not sure I'd like Skyrim much.  I've played Oblivion and thought it was ok, but found too much about it that irked me... sluggish controls, sloppy combat, tedious leveling system, etc... I've also played Fall Out 3 and New Vegas and although both seemed decent just were not for me.  I couldn't get into them.  So I picked up Skyrim just to see what all the hype was about.  I sat down put in the disk and didn't get up again for six hours.  Instantly hooked.Everything that bothered me about Oblivion was improved upon.  Better graphics, better controls, better combat.  The only thing about it which isn't as polished as it should have been is the menus and inventory management, but it doesn't take much time to get used to.  The environment is the more realistic and engrossing I've seen in any game.  The world seems more realistic and alive than any other.The quests are interesting and the main storyline is good.  However, for a game about dragons, they aren't as intimidating or as strong and powerful as they should be.  It seems a bit odd that at low levels I'm slaying dragons, but a bear can tear me apart in a few hits.Overall, it is an amazing game."
"Overall this game is great. My self i wasn't a big fan of oblivion so i was a little nervous on getting this game, but i am very happy i did. The graphics and detail are so much more improved, the combat is great as well. The thing that just blows me away is how big skyrim and how many different types of enemies there are. Theres always some new enemies whether its a giant crab or big foot, to a wizard to a walking tree. Also the customization is great. So many things to unlock with the skill tree, armour  ,weapons and much more. Also when you go to a town you can cut wood, work at a farm, get a house,ever get married.Some things that get annoying would be when your getting chased by a enemy and they are too fast and too strong to kill/run from they will kill you in like one shot. Im only a level 10 and its hard to kill giants and saber cats. Something else that is annoying is if you steal something from a shop or something from someone in a town the whole town will chase you and even after you leave if you come back they will try and kill you. That was super annoying when i took a horse from a imperial guard and he started chasing me, but the stupid thing is im a imperial guard as well, so i had to load another save since i couldn't go back to that town or they would kill me."
"This game has enough quests to keep you busy for the next 12 years.  It is a dungeon crawlers dream.  Dragons are amazing and the graphics are a huge step forward for Bethesda.  Great compared to other games?  Nope.  But they are much much better.  No classes which is awesome and you can go anywhere you want.  There is a lot of good to this game.  BUT...  the at times gamebreaking glitches are too much.  Shout Word Walls that don't work.  Quest items that if you pick up before you are suppose to do so breaks that quest (e.g. mage book fetch quest).  The only other problem worth noting is you will eventually get to the point where your character is waaayyyy over powered.  A thief can take on a dragon by himself.  A wizard can wipe out enemies.  And if you are a heavily armored warrior...  Good night.  You will maul things in your path by the time you get close to finishing, simply wiping out large groups with little effort."
"This game is easily the best, most immersive single player game I have ever played. There's so much content in this game for $60, it's mind blowing. The quests are great, and 32hrs in, I have barely scratched the surface. The gameplay is solid, and the graphics/landscapes are beautiful(uninstalled on the harddrive lol). This is a definate, do what you want, play the way you want game. I've never been into RPG's that much, but this game has won me over with the scale, and the do whatever you want gameplay.5 Stars...10/10...A+I am following others in predicting this will be GOTY 2011!"
"This game is so fantastic. I've been going very slow and doing general exploring, reading all the books (some of which have fantastic stories that broaden the world for me), I want to save doing the main quest lines for when I feel like mixing things up, but that's the beauty of this game. You can play HOW YOU WANT To! Do whatever you feel like. If you like scale, think old EQ 1999 and how huge it was, and marveling at details like stars and clouds and bridges and buildings and snow and trees and water flowing... My gosh this game is an explorer or crafters dreams. Want combat and danger, plenty to be had, want to pick flowers and work on your alchemy, go ahead! It's an amazing adventure that you have the freedom to play ANYWAY you Want To! Couldn't say enough good things, it's wonderful, magic in a bottle, and the most amazing game I have ever played!Cons:Some of the texture details are slightly blurred, it doesn't bother me, because it's rare I even notice. This is a gigantic world and I'm not surprised there are graphical hiccups here and there, but nothing you can't forgive or forget as the northern lights blaze across a beautiful evening sky.Don't hesitate to buy this unless you honestly don't have the time to play. Because this is the kind of game you could play for hundreds of hours and still not see and find everything. (My impressions thus far!)Ps. This review is for the X-Box 360, and the controls work flawlessly!"
"This is going to be a short review just because obviously there are plenty of LONG LONG reviews you can read. I just wanted to say that if you are looking for a RPG, action/adventure game with TONS of content stop wasting your time and reading reviews and buy this game. No one can honestly rate this below 3 stars even if they are mad at this game. Its beautiful, filled with content that will keep you busy for longer than any other game on the market, a lot of fun to play, and my choice for GOTY. In all honesty this is the only game I have bought EVER that I felt justified the $60 price tag. I actually feel like for once that I received the best end of the deal. If you are waiting for the game to reduce in price you will be waiting a long time!!! Pick it up now, its well worth the $ and if this was the only game you had you would still have more on your plate then you could handle. And for those of you waiting on the GOTY edition release with the extra content. I'm sorry because you are missing out. I dont mind spending a little extra $ to get one of the greatest games ever made!"
"This was probably one of the most anticipated games of the year for me, and I have to say that having put so much time into it, and planning on putting more time to seek out random dungeons that this game not only had me from start to finish, but left me wanting more. In the game you start off as a captive of the Imperials, this is going to be your execution day, but something happens. A Dragon attacks and all hell breaks loose. Somehow you're going to have to manage to fight your way out, and once on the other side, you're going to have the entire land of Skyrim at your disposal. Explore the lands, take on quests, join guilds, join a faction, and ultimately save the realm.Graphically this game looked amazing, the amount of scenary/buildings/mountains/etc was more than a little impressive. Sure there's some texture and structure loading issues when traveling out in Skyrim, but for the most part you're going to find that there's a lot to explore, and a wide variety of stuff to look at. You're going to have glaciers, snow, mountains, fields, forests, caves, and more. This is the type of adventure game you can easily get lost in. The NPC faces do get a bit generic if you do a good amount of exploring, especially when it comes to enemies that you come across. There's so much to see though, that you're probably not going to wonder why a huge chunk of city dwelling people look like they came from the same mother at the exact same birth.The music in Skyrim is also top notch. You have orchestra pieces to listen to, and you also have changes in music to denote different events. If you're being attacked, if you've entered into a cave, if you're just exploring Skyrim, there's a good variety of music to listen to. I will recommend one thing, if you enter an inn or a place where there is someone singing, just ask them to take a break, you'll thank me later.The controls in the game will have you utilizing every button the the controller. You'll have a trigger for one hand (be it for a shield, a spell, or another weapon), and of course the other trigger for the other weapon. You'll have a button to jump, a button to select/pick up/talk with, and of course a cancel button. You'll be using both shoulder buttons once you're a bit into the game, and the analog sticks are going to be your friends when you're trying to track dragons flying in the sky.One thing that this game promised was a ton of a dragons, and man did they deliver. You're going to have to face quite a few just to get from the beginning of the game to the end, but there's also the chance of just going out into the world and hunting dragons. There's dragon nests scattered across the land that you can go to a take down some of the meaner dragons. There's just so much to this game I don't even know where to start. You're going to get to craft your character and level them up with the actions that you take. Unlike Oblivion where you can cheat the system with your skill selections, this time around you're going to level up skills by utilizing that action (lockpicking, one-hand fighting, blocking, smithing, etc), and as you level skills up you're going to level up your character which in turn will allow you to boost a stat (magic, health, stamina) and then also give you a perk point to give you a little something extra in one of the skill fields. Now to stop you from just choosing the best perks of different skills there are skill level requirements (separate from your character's level) that have to be met in order to unlock that perk. Personally I made sure that most of my perks went into lockpicking, as that seemed to be a game inside the game for me, and allowed me to gain the riches that my character finished the game with. There are a couple of groups that you can join throughout the game, you have the Companions (basically the Fighter's Guild, but with a dark twist), the College of Magic, the Thieves Guild (this too has a twist), the Bard's college, the Stormcloaks (basically the renegade faction), the Imperials (the ruling and conquering faction), and/or the Dark Brotherhood (Assassin's Guild). With so much to do, plus a ton of other quests this game will eat up hours of your life, but in a good way.There are, however, a few issues I have with the game. First off there were some bad bugs that could become your undoing, and cause you to restart a good ways back in your game, so don't be afraid to use multiple saves and save often. My personal issue with the game was that there was a quest that once turned on you could no longer fast travel (which once you've started to play Skyrim, you'll see makes the game almost unplayable), there has as been texture issues, weird geometry stuff going on, dragons flying backwards, and characters that you have to converse with that either don't ever appear or disappear when you need to talk to them to continue a quest. Then there's the other issue in the game, the main storyline. Maybe it was just me, but I wanted to do anything but work on the main storyline, it just didn't feel up to par with some of the side quests. Sure it had its interesting parts, but there wasn't enough substance to it, I didn't feel as invested in it as say the later Thieves Guild quests. There's also the Misc. quests that you'll get, those can screw you over royally simply because there are way too many times when you can't remember who the hell you have to turn the quest into, there's never an indicator, and sometimes it will make items stay in your inventory forever, as they are seen as quest items, and you can't drop quest items. That being said, completing the main quest doesn't mean that the game will end, thankfully you'll be able to continue on exploring to your heart's desire. Hell if you play long enough I'm sure you can just start killing everyone in Skyrim and just have the place to yourself, if that's something that interests you.In the end, with its flaws, and it's not quite epicly awesome main storyline, this is a game that I couldn't get enough of. Sure there were some game freezes, and sure there were some glitches, but it says something about the game when I simply said a string of curse words, then restarted the 360 and started playing again. I became invested in the world, I wanted to explore every nook and cranny, I wanted to become that hero that could make all who oppose me feel my wrath. So I think it's safe to say that if you like open world RPGs where you get to fight dragons, save the world, and have a good sense of adventure, you're going to have already bought this game, or if you haven't you need to get this game pronto, like right now, as soon as you're done reading this, go get the game and get lost in it like so many others have before you. This game gets a 9.4 out of 10."
"When it comes down to it, Skyrim is basically Oblivion. Dark, dungeon crawler but a whole lot of fun. Graphics are amazing and being able to craft and specialize in so many area's is great. 2handed specialization with decapitation is probably my new all time favorite. Fatalities in the game make it extra fun its just a shame there is no fatalities for bow users :( I guess you just have to admire the arrows sticking out of their eye sockets!Storyline is amazing! Fighting dragons is a blast. If you like oblivion you'll love skyrim and vice versa. I'm sure im leaving out a whole lot but theirs so much to be said its best if you just try the game yourself."
"Elder Scrolls V: SkyrimElder Scrolls 5: Skyrim is hands down the best game that I have played this year. The game is absolutely epic offering the player so many areas to visit and so many missions and side quests to undertake.  I am already over 30 hours into the game, however, I have barely touched the main Story quests.  The game also gives the player the freedom to choose how to customize their character and also what skill set to use with your character.  Each person who plays this game will experience things in a completely different way."
"I dont know what else to say that hasn't been said. It's fun, exciting, long great game.  I love sandbox gamese like red dead, la noir, etc. and this is no exception.  Except this has more rpg elements.It's not that hard and lots of missions and quests you can do.Did I mention how BEAUTIFUL the game is!  The music is also very relaxing to listen to.  Very epic.  I wish they had a multiplayer option.  OMFG that would be so awesome.  My dream would be a game like this - done star wars style.  Listening Lucasarts???"
"i have spent almost 200 hours playing this game so far and have not finished the game.this is the best game i have played in many years,so much fun"
"I love this game, cannot stop playing it :D It has a few bugs here and there, but no major problems that interfere with the gameplay."
"I think God made this game. This is the best RPG game ever. Skyrim is a must get game. I love a game that has detail  . When you see your first dragon it will make you smile. I love all the perks, armor, magic, weapons, and journeys in Skyrim. You will not beat this game in no one day, or a week. Lol great with turlebeaches."
"My first Elder Scrolls game was Oblivion so I got to the party a little late, but I'm trying to make up for lost time.  If you are looking for one adventure RPG to play for the rest of your life this should be a strong contender.  It's a huge world, much bigger than Oblivion, with an obscene number of things to do and ways to play.  I'm about 30 hours in and nowhere near completing the main story line...I probably haven't even discovered half of the towns or locations."
"Simply put, this is one of the finest video games ever created. Living up to the Elder Scrolls series is tough (I know, I've played them all), but this one passes the muster. Absolutely enthralling...."
"There is no need for me to go into a detailed written review about this game since so many others have already done that.  This game is, hands down, the greatest, most immersing single player RPG ever to hit the market.  Play this game with caution; it will rip your life away.......you've been warned."
The world is huge and the game is addictive.  I'm close to 36 hours in and have yet to complete the smallest portion of the main storyline quests.  An absolute per hour value for the price.  I highly recommend.
"This is the shortest review im going to write ever, this game is GOTY materiel. It is so beautiful and has something to offer anyone. Do yourself a favor and buy this game immediatly, now I must get back to it! FUS RO DAH!"
"Alright I ordered skyrim today, 11-24-11. I have been wanting this game ever since they announced it. I pre-ordered it but than decided to cancel when my friend told me it was stupid. I found out yesturday that the only reason he ssid that was cause he didn't want me to get it that he wanted to be the only one with it. I played at a friends house and damn! I've played fallout 3, fallout new vegas, and oblivion and this is the best by far. IT HAS TO BE GAME OF THE YEAR! when you play it you'll reilize what I mean. There are 500+ quests and tons of locations to explore. There is still a few bugs but they are making a patch for it so it dosnt matter. This is a definate must buy!"
"Skyrim is shaping up to be one of my favorite games of 2011 for Xbox 360. I played the heck out of Oblivion, and Skyrim lives up to the Elder Scrolls name with its freedom to play however you want. I love that in games today, and Skyrim IMHO does it the best. The graphics are amazing and the gameplay is fluid and easy to understand. One of the best games of 2011 and quite possibly of all time."
"If you only buy one game this year, Skyrim is it. Nothing else comes close. There are literally hundreds of hours of gameplay."
"UPDATE: I waited a few more months for updates and fixes and gave the game another shot. To say that I am utterly hooked would, somehow, be an understatement. I absolutely love the game. However, I want to draw attention to something. These Elder Scrolls games receive ""get out of jail free"" passes when they are buggy at launch, and if I had stuck around and endured the problems some had (and that I clearly started with), I don't know if I'd be enjoying the game as much as I am now that a few patches have been released. In all, I am shocked about the level of vitriol from other commenters who either assumed I was an imbecile or decided that an unusable game didn't deserve a bad score. ""Your x-box sux! You deserve it for renting the game! Maybe your disk is scratched! (Insert sound of labored mouth-breathing here.)"" All of these comments are unhelpful and, ultimately, embarrassing to their authors. The flaws and bugs in the game were eventually well-documented, including random freezes like I encountered. I am glad that most are ironed out now. I still occasionally see a random mammoth dropping out of the sky, hiccuping back into the sky, warping back and forth, and then finally dying in a glorious upheaval of tusk and inertia. I smile at the silly bugs and am glad that my game-breaking bugs have vanished.I have updated my score from 1 to 4 stars. Definitely would have given it 5 if I hadn't had such a bad initial experience. Original review follows.P.S. Pro tip: If you ever write a review response in which you want to say something akin to ""That never happened to me, so you're wrong!"" just don't comment. If everyone spent time talking about the things that *didn't* happen to them, the Internet would be even more dense with useless information.-----------------------I was very excited to play this game, and I rented it from Redbox on opening weekend. Not what I would call an epic opening. Not many will pine back to this sequence and say, ""Remember that awesome intro movie when you were talking to strangers on a horse cart for five minutes straight?"" As soon as I exited the introductory area, and saw the whole wide world in front of me, I was exhilarated...besides, no more horse cart conversation. It could only go up from here!Right out of the intro area, I walked straight and a little left. This led me to a small camp of bandits not 30 seconds from the dungeon mouth from with I had just exited. ""It's go time,"" I thought, and moved in for the attack. As I walked around the periphery of the camp, the bandits noticed me. ""That's close enough,"" I heard them say at a distance. ""So awesome!"" I think to myself. They are watching me and not just attacking on sight!Of course, I had to interrupt the Bandit Party(TM) and loosed an arrow into the forehead of the largest one. That made them angry--go figure. They came charging down the hill into a full-on spray of fire from my magical right hand. One bandit roasted, well done, and I am successfully holding off the other with my shield. ""Your turn!"" I shout to his compatriot, to my own embarrassment, after all, I am in my living room. Then the game freezes, my mace frozen in time and in bad guy face. No buttons respond, including the X-box button. This hasn't happened to be since my red ring of death days with my old Xbox. A little anxious, I reset the machine and reload from the end of the intro dungeon area.Those bandits are going to pay this time. No more Mr. Subtle. I charge right into the camp, hand a-blazing, and ... everything freezes. Reboot. New strategy. Arrows from a hidey hole! Freeze.If I can't attack the first group of bandits I encounter right out of the first dungeon without a game and system breaking malfunction, then I am sorry, but this is not acceptable."
"First things first. I have no life. I openly admit it, and accept it for what it is. That being said, I literally have over 100 hours of playing time in this game. Over 85 hours on my primary character, with 2 additional characters created, and likely 20+ hours of time lost due to getting killed, and being bounced back 10 minutes to the latest save point. These experiences have taught me to save often. But on to the meat of this review.The game play is simply awesome, with beautiful graphics, and different quest lines to follow. You choose your own adventure. Someone asks you if you can help find their sister, you can be a nice guy and help them out, a mean guy and tell them to get bent, or truly evil and drop an arrow into their forehead. I have enjoyed all of The Elder Scrolls series thus far, and this exceeded my expectations.I did have a hard time getting into this game initially. I had 2-3 hours in while I was walking my way to one of the major cities. I got jumped by a creature in the wilds which is, it seems, well known for kicking the crap out of people who wander too far off the beaten path. I lost nearly an hour of game time, because of where the last auto-save point was. I actually put it down for about a week, and focused on hitting my first level of prestige in MW3. The other major part that irritated me was some of the quests. I had a companion following me around for around the first 20 hours of game time. I picked up a quest, and my companion said ""I'm headed home now. You'll know where to find me."" The quest wanted me to meet someone at a dungeon or cave, and because of that I lost my companion for nearly 50 hours, because that's how long it took me to make it to said dungeon. There is just so much to do in this game, it doesn't always make sense to knock off stricly one quest at a time. Sometimes its better to bounce around, which is what I did for 50 hours. LoL.Overall, a beautifully created game. Sometimes there's too much to do, and sometimes it can be irritating to die at just the wrong spot, but the end result is quite worth it."
"I heard Skyrim was better than Arena. Better than Daggerfall. Better than Morrowind. Better than Oblivion.Since I am an adventurer, I was going to buy this game but then I took an arrow in the knee.But I wasn't going to let an arrow or three stop me, so:Is Skyrim better than Arena? Better than Daggerfall? Better than Morrowind? Better than Oblivion?Yes. If you liked any of the prior Elder Scrolls, you are sure to love this game. If you liked *all* of the prior installments, you probably already own this game.It's a good thing you don't need to use your knees to play this game."
"Most innovation in a game I have seen this year./*UPDATE related to XBOX issue wanted to share*/I have had a few issues with freezing, I mean a few like 5-10 times in 40 hours of play, and the only way to correct it is a system restart. This destroys the immersive effect of the game. I left the game at five stars because it still deserves it, Just wanted to share this bit of information with potential buyers./*Original Post*/I was apprehensive about Skyrim after Bethesda had issues with a buggy New Vegas and an epic failure on Brink, but I was right to believe that an in house development of one of their signature titles would deliver. I am 10 hours into the game (so basically barely getting started) but all the quests I have completed are of the highest quality. The npc and npc followers have great dialog options and the voice acting is top notch. I am having a great time and plan to finish the game some time in the next 100 hours!Pros:- Leveling system is much better than in the past, much faster paced as well, I have been enjoying the leveling and skill trees, they are great looking and intuitive to use.- Areas are vast, water looks real and flows in a cool realistic way. I actually fell over a few waterfalls the ride was awesome!- I love the new inventory/menu system, this is supported by the quick select for favorites that allows you to quickly change spell and weapon sets.- Climbing is improved, well jumping up stuff is easier. This makes getting to mountains tops easier, and allows players to enjoy the Skyrim environments to the fullest.- The variety of animals, herbs, flowers, and other crafting materials is SO VAST that I have stuff I am not sure I can use hanging around in my inventory (now weight so no issue), I caught a few butterflies out of the air today, I am trying to craft with them now, not sure what I will be able to create using them but I am excited about the options.-Blacksmith, crafting and refining existing items or creating all new items is like nothing I have ever seen, everything is fair game and the crafting system is so intuitive that I had no learning curve at all, started crafting at the first smith I found.- There are dragons that breath Fire/Ice, they move like they are real, they track you as you move, they add to your voice spells when you absorb their souls. Very nicely done.- Three spells at a time can be equipped, well 2 spells and 1 voice/yell but I love the voice options, they are powerful and useful.- I could do this for pages and pages, I am so happy with this game that I will just say everything about this games exceeds my expectations, I can't wait until we get a Fallout game from Bethesda in house again.Cons:- I said five stars, I meant it!So in closing, This game is the only game this year that I personally feel exceeded all the hype, so I recomend it, and hope you enjoy it as much as I am."
"When you sit down to rate a game like the Elder Scrolls V, you really are faced with a horrid uphill battle. The games are massive, so its hard to pinpoint specific issues with areas due to the insane amount of them, Its also hard to communicate spells, weapons or just about anything else without kind of ballparking the general idea that Bethesda is going for, as well as incorporating what you've figured out so far. The main issue is a review for this game should take years of notes. There is just so much content that to fully prepare a reader, you'd need to cram 300 + hours of questing, leveling, fighting and customization into a review not even three pages. In short, if I miss something, that's why.***TOC:******1. The Basic Jist***2. Changes and improvements:******2A: Movement******2B: Menus******2C: Quickselect******2D: Magic******2E: Hands******2F: Perks******2G: Speech******2H: Non Returners******2I: The New Leveling System******2J: Creation***3. Gameplay***4. Issues***5 Wrap Up***1. The Basic Jist:***You're a prisoner from a raid ambush, and are the Dragonborn, a mortal with the soul of a Dragon, Without having really quested too far, the idea here is simple, you are prophesied and therefore destined to be awesome and save the world. Pretty much the general main plot of most of these type of games. The reason being a Dragonborn is important is that apparently, only the Dragonborn can fight dragons with their own words. To learn Dragon Power Words you must find the word, and learn that, but to use a Power Word, you must have a Dragon's Soul, and only a person who is Dragonborn can absorb the power of other Dragons. If you're confused, its okay. I'm not fully in complete understanding either. But, that's the basic story. I'm going to move on to the differences (the main meat of this review) of TES:V.***2. Improvements and Changes:***Whenever a game undergoes an evolution, it changes, becomes more or less refined, and in general tends to improve, and this game is no different.***2A: Movement:Characters move more fluidly, Especially in 3rd person view, this game, for the first time in the series, has focused more on how your character moves when in 3rd person, the jumping, landing and general movement animations look good and realistic, this also extends to the enemies you fight, and finally the animation to attacking which is better, and also more realistic. Finishers have also been added, and their animations are also fluid and well done, if a bit haphazard at times.***2B: Menus:This is a mixed bag for me due to the massive difference from Oblivion, but all in all, i find it cleaner and faster than Oblivion's as well, its also considerably less cluttered and texty. Basically, when you press B, you use the d-pad up, down, left, or right, buttons to use Skill, Map, Magic, or Inventory Items respectively. This is a big shock at first due to the just odd nature and drastic severance from previous games, but all in all the inventory and magic screens are easy to use, auto sorted, and The map is very nice, all while still being cohesive. The only thing that is massively different here that further needs addressing is the Skills, which I'll cover later.Continuing with the menu, the stamina bar (green) is lower right, Health (red) is in the Center, and the Blue bar on the bottom left is Magicka. While these are often out of your way, there is actually no way to know how much health you have left in digit form. In oblivion you could check via the first status screen and it'd give how much you had. This way its kind of just there on the bottom. Its cohesive yes, but, there's not a simple way to check R.G.B. bar buffs. But the system works. Enemy health is shown for hostile enemies in the top center and the compass is there as well. The only other things on the screen are pretty much the enemies and occasionally you. While vastly different, the menu's are easy to use and easy to navigate.***2C: Quickselect:As we know it its gone. The wheel is replaced by a list brought up by the up button on normal play on the d-pad. This pauses the world while you select what you'd like to use. Populating this list is done by navigating the magic or item menus and highlighting equipment/spells and pressing Y. The list becomse populated and is a crucial tool for all play types for potions, spells, and weapons needed on the go. Its also seems pretty bottomless.***2D: MagicThe BIGGEST Change in this game. Gone are custom spells, spellcrafting, and The hassle of weeding through 1400 spells to find the one you want. They've simplified the spells to being learned from books, easily purchased and read from salespeople. But the Perks system and Hands System refine and customize your spells. In short, the spells are all prescripted, but now are mix and match, holdable, and are not leveled the same way as before.Mix and Match- You can use two spells at once, or two of the same spell at once, or with a dagger or other one hander, or with a shield or however you like! Use fire and cure, fire and ice, Rage and Paralyze. Sky's the limit.Hold: Many spells are holdable, meaning you can reap benefits from the spell the longer you use the spell with LT or RT Instead of boinking the button 8000 times. Some are still fired though and some must be charged ""cooked"" and then fired.Level: More on this later, but the spells don't level unless you're using them now, making them harder to grind, But they are more battle friendly so you'll actually use them.***2E:Hands!The hand system is another big step forward, you have full customize-ability of your right and left hand. You can equip 2 swords/maces/daggers one, and a shield a shield and magic, a staff and magic , the list goes on. You can essentially fully utilize your character the way you want now.***2F: PerksPerks are located in the Skills tab when you level. When you do you get one point to spend on a perk. When you look through your Skills such as Destruction, or Restoration, each has a constellation associated with it. Pressing a allows you to see how you can customize this skill set. Things are available such as a bonus 25% to fire damage or Destruction spells are 1/2 magicka. If you have the level and the prerequisites, you can spend your points on a star in the constellation, giving you the bonus and turning it from white to yellow. Some have multiple levels as well.  This allows much deeper customization and more unique characters as you build them to be better at the skills you use the most, since low level skills usually do not have the ability to utilize Perks Points.***2G: SpeechSpeech here is handled much differently than the close up shot from oblivion, here its a non changed camera angle, the characters simply speak to one another on the screen. There is also no personality mini game. The voice acting has been massively expanded, as such many characters feel more unique and many voices aren't as recycled as in Oblivion. However, not all the voice talent was great, but honestly its better than the like 12 people they had for oblivion.***2H: Non returners:Many movement related skills are gone, specific weapon Skills are replaced with one or two handers, many others are more simplified or missing. This is to smooth out the game, keep it grindy but not feel like grinding. Least it feels that way. The old leveling system is also gone, as well as the old system for spell creation.***2I: The New Leveling System:The System of old simply used two types of abilities. In Morrowind 10 advances in minor skills would net a level or 5 major skills would. This was changed to 10 major skills only in Oblivion. Then you would get to level your attributes when you slept. Here, there is no sleeping no attributes and no leveling requirement. The easiest way I can explain it is that you level by doing whatever. When you advance in any skill it adds to the level pool. But the higher the skill being leveled, the more of a percentage will be added. So you get more exp for leveling your destruction from 5-6 than you do for moving it from 2-3. Levels are also instant and benefits can be reaped immediately. The game allows you to level your RGB (Health, Stamina, Magicka) bars by 10 points at a time upon level.***2J: CreationYou no longer can create stuff all over the place on foot. Potions, Armors ,and Enchantments require a workstation. Each of these three has a corresponding skill tree. The skills allow you to create and upgrade armors, create potions and poisons, and enchant weapons and armor. Its also very worth it to create you own stuff as it will be better than most merchants' with time.Whew, that was a lot of changes, so what about the rest of the game? are the changes good or bad?***3. Gameplay***All in all, this game plays very well. From most of the videos I watched, Bethesda was trying to make the system punish players less by making the system reward them for work put in, and allow them to just play as their races without messing with signs and the like, allowing the player to have a looser mold of their character.  The problem they wanted to avoid wasthe , ""I messed up my character"" restart. They were very successful.The customization options are plentiful, good looking, and cool, the beginning of the game is much less text based and Gives you the ability to essentially do what you want in the weapons or self defense departments, actually giving you all the different types of weapons within the first 15-30 minutes to try out with and use.The whole TES V experience is seamless and immersive and its a very very fun game. That being said, it incorporates a lot of challenge.The game goes back to the Morrowind-esque difficulty model where some monsters will wreck your face if you're not ready to face them yet, also removing the level scaling. This gives the game's zones more depth and their own feel, instead of seeing Daedra everywhere at max level like in Oblivion. I do sense some scaling, but its not as prevalent.To make a long story short, not many bugs, good story and controls, and good interfaces, coupled with a good exp and fight system, and this game plays awesome. Not to mention this game contains massive amounts of sidequesting and other random stuff you can do. TES has a huge amount of playtime associated with it, and its not for the faint of heart, nor the casual RPG player. But I've focused enough of its positives, what's its problems?***4: Issues:***TES V has some issues, the same things that make it great also break it.*** Its not a short game, don't expect to be able to be the biggest baddest warrior ever in a few hours. You'll be lucky to start swinging right by then.*** Its grindy. This ties in with the above, and it will take serious time to max skills, whether you have the patience for this game can make or break it.*** The map is big and a lot of the time its hard to find new places in a good time frame, that being said, there is fast travel available.*** Too many quests! So much to keep track of, and so many distractions. You can literally play this game for more than 200 hours and not TOUCH the story. So its possible to wear the game out before really ever actually playing it.*** The interface can be problematic, its simple but its occasionally annoying since pressing B always exits the whole menu, you'll do it accidentally a lot. remember only selecting things with A and using the D-pad and finishing with B, otherwise you'll be bringing up the menu a lot more often that you want to.*** No default Subtitles. The game is surprisingly quiet. Subtitles should be on so you don't miss things. I believe they can be turned on but, well yeah.*** Graphical bugs and occasional Texture blandness. Being as big as it is, I'm not surprised, some bugs happen but there is a known issue with the caching system for installed games for the textures on 360. If the game looks bad, its likely due to the install you performed. Bethesda is trying to fix.*** The interface for perks is clunky and difficult to use. Its evry difficult to get the perk you want if its in an odd placement from where you sit currently on the grid. It makes perk usage more irritating than it should.***5 Wrap Up:***All in all this game is phenomenal. I can make what I want, kill who I want, Do quests, Don't, Kill big things or run like a sissy. The game allows me to do basically whatever I want, How I want, and is in essence the best Sandbox RPG to date. Does it have some issues? Yes, a few, but not any you're likely to not be able to overcome. This is one of those games you either love or hate, not because its bad, but because there is just so many play styles out there will be some people that just don't like games like this. The game isn't really fast paced, but it doesn't need to be since its so big. So is it good? Yes, Yes it is, but bear in mind, this game is a big undertaking.TES V: is a great game, and really redefined the series, and its easily a contender for game of the year. Its a great game for the right player, and very much worth the money, it'll last a long time, with massive replay value. Highly recommended."
"Simply put, this game is wonderful in detail, breathtaking in scope, and deep in gameplay options. Once you play through the intro, you are free to play the game anyway you want and forge your own legend! Highly recommended."
I have played a couple hours and has been a fun experience. I expected a little more from the graphics though as I do not see that much of an improvement over oblivion. All in all fun game.
"If you don't know what Skyrim is, I pity you. This is the single best creation of humankind. Human beings evolved over millions of years just to make this game. It has better graphics than real life. If you don't buy this game--I'm sorry, that's a syntax error. It's impossible to NOT get this game. You can freeze rabbits by screaming at them. I don't have to say anything more than that. Hell, if I knew nothing else, that would be enough."
I loved Oblivion and was very excited for this to come out.  I rented it a few times before I decided to purchase it.  It's a great game that will keep me entertained for a long time to come.
"FIRST IMPRESSIONSAnyone dreaming of hundreds of hours of immersive RPG play stretched over months and months of awesome adventures must come to Skyrim (West of Morrowind, North of Cyrodiil, by the Sea of Ghosts) because there's nothing better today.This is not a full review because it should take me months to complete the game if something the size and scope of Skyrim can ever be completed - I still bump into new quests in Oblivion 3 or 4 years after I thought I 'completed' it. So, for what is worth, this is my experience after the first few hours in Skyrim. I expect to keep updating, expanding and refining this review as I play.So... after my first few dozen hours in Skyrim... comparisons with Oblivion beg to be made and the best I can say now is that us, Oblivion veterans, this much-awaited new installment will not disappoint. The land is bigger, the views are breathtaking, the characters you encounter are more varied and significantly more intelligent, the voices and the musical score are levels above what we had in Elders Scrolls IV. And, almost to my surprise, no bugs. Sure, I've only scratched the surface but there were no crashes yet and no significant frame rate drops or maybe I was so into playing my part I didn't have time to notice them.To anyone trying or who considers trying an RPG I'd say 'go for it' because Skyrim is the best there is in this category today. By far.RPG FEATURES AND THE ELDER SCROLLS HERITAGESkyrim shares the lore and has a lot in common with Morrowind and Oblivion. I've already heard of the Blades, of the Nine, of the Thieves and, of course, the Nords who were found in and around Bruma are the majority group here. In time, I expect to uncover a lot more things in common between this world and those from prior game. Still hope to stumble upon Umbra, my favorite Oblivion sword, at the bottom of some dungeon. A lot of it feels very familiar - did I mention Sheogorath? - but there's a much more modern/advanced-looking interface that makes everything so much more fluid and more natural-feeling - if fighting a giant spider with a sword can be called 'natural'Like many 'modern' RPGs, Skyrim doesn't care much about classes. You become 'you' based on what you do and how well you do it. Practice doesn't necessarily make perfect but it certainly seems to make better. If swords is your favorite argument to settle disputes then, after much practice, you are likely to become an expert swordsman and so for. Or you can try stealth and aim at becoming the best cutthroat the world of Skyrim has ever seen. It's really up to you/me.The skills have been simplified and streamlined a little, their number reduced to 18. I didn't see 'athletics', for example and I don't believe Skyrim has such skills as 'blunt'.The magic schools are a little different with 'mysticism' gone but with 'shouts' added as a new and innovative type of magic - the longer you shout, the stronger the effect.Combat adds 'block' as an active skill. Just keeping your shield up is no longer good enough.Oh... and... 'dragons'. I've only encountered one so far and so much fun it was, especially with the rumble turned on in the controller and a good surround sound you feel the turbulence the giant wings create while flying within inches of your face and the ground shaking when the beast lands (big mistake on the dragon's part) to confront you directly.THE TECHNICAL MERITI confess that, following the bug-plagued Fallout series, I was a little apprehensive and was prepared for the worst. But, as I mentioned already, the game turns out to be bug free so far. We'll see how it behaves as we move further into the world and the interactions and dependencies multiply. I will add more to this section later but so far I'm quite impressed.By the way, the controls and the streamlined user interface feel great. And... a 3-D map? I love it.MY RATINGThe contents of my review are likely to change but I can't see how my rating could possibly go below 5 stars. Skyrim promises to be the best console game I've ever played and it's likely to stay this way for a while.->> Brush your teeth, it's the law! &lt;&lt;"
"I got Skyrim about 2 1/2 weeks, and I've been playing it quite a bit. I can definitely tell you this game deserves a lot of sales and a significantly larger fanbase. It's an amazing ""sequel"" I guess you can say, to Oblivion. Heck, it could even be Game of the Year worthy. That's just my opinion. However, there are some fields where the game falls back, and some things that make Oblivion stand out better. So, here are TWO pro and con lists, one for Skyrim as a standalone, and one comparing it to Oblivion.Pros Standalone+You can shake hundreds of hours out of this game, on one file. Thousands if more than one file!+Specific things level the more you do them, and there are several branches.+Looks amazing. (though personally I don't care for graphics)+Hundreds of quests and objectives, and the game helps you walk through them.+Huge selection of weapons, armor, apparel, and even in game books that teach you stuff or start quests.+Ability to decorate your house the way you want... to an extent (more on that later)+Several different groups to join, and deep stories within each one.+Every location in the game has a significance, not just it being there to kill monsters. There's a quest or story behind each location.+Several different magic spells to use.+It has a sense of realism to it, even if it is a fantasy RPG.Cons Standalone-Even after the two updates we've had so far, the game takes even longer to load. It takes awhile.-Speech is one hell of a skill to level, and it never seems the shopkeepers have enough money to sell most/all of your loot until you either take the long route to master it, or you take advantage of something, which makes the game unfair.-Money is really difficult to make in the beginning of the game, let alone storing your extra gear.-There are still a ton of glitches after the past few updates, such as when you try to place items throughout your house, when you leave/reenter the area, they fall back on the floor, and on some consoles the weapon plaques don't work... just go on the UESP wiki, there's a page full of glitches that haven't been fixed yet.-Game has frozen on my Xbox a few times, and at terrible timing.Pros VS. Oblivion+Less skills to level, but they have combined most similar skills (such as Blunt and Blade and Hand to Hand) for more unique skills.+Speechcraft and Mercantile have combined and made the skill overall slightly easier to level up, basically by talking to tons of people and using persuasion/intimidate/bribery, or just selling tons of crap one item at a time.+Your Magicka is no longer capped at 200 without fortified equipment.+Ability to use two swords (personally my favorite way of fighting in any RPG)+When an enemy parries an attack, you don't get recoiled/knocked back as irritably as you did in Oblivion. Come on, you all know how much fun putting up with that was.+Bound weapons last longer and don't cost an obscene amount of MP to use it for 15 seconds *coughBoundSwordcough*+Bound Bow has its own arrows so you don't have to waste your arrows (kinda goes with the Bound weapons section but still)+Healing spells don't cost an obscene amount of MP to heal as much HP (247 MP to heal 25 HP a second for 4 seconds? I don't think so!)+Enchanting is a lot better in this game than Oblivion, considering the side effects of the enchantments are a lot more powerful, you can boost the effect of your enchantments with Alchemy potions, and they are more effective than that enchantment altar.+Finding the 'Stones' I guess you can call them are easier and more effective, as they are marked on your map. (The stones from the signs from Oblivion, such as the warrior, steed, etc)+Riding a horse is easier.+The leveling is easier in this game and less stressing (such as trying to get that +5 attribute increase per level) You can choose between HP, MP, and Stamina, and then save your perks for when you decide. You can also level ANY skill and it level your progress up.Cons VS. Oblivion-Can't have stuff equipped in both hands and still use magic (such as a sword and shield, bow, and warhammer) You have to have one hand free to use the spell.-Alchemy is dumbed down by quite a bit. All of the effects are a mystery (unless you eat the first one but it's hard to find two ingredients that have the same first effect) so you're stuck either wasting time doing trial and error to find ingredients that match, wasting time to look up online or on a guidebook for what ingredient has what effect, or wasting up to three perks to eat an ingredient and having all the ingredients in the game's database. Leveling Alchemy is much of a bigger pain because now it doesn't base off how many potions you make. It bases off the value of the potion you make, and making expensive potions can be a pain, let alone finding a good amount of the ingredients to make such potions. I mean yeah now you don't have to worry about raising Alchemy level to unlock more effects, but this isn't worth it.-Increasing your carrying capacity is more of a hassle. In Oblivion you could cap your strength at 100 and have 500 capacity, plus anything from fortifying Strength/Feather on equipment, let alone using a Feather spell to increase it even further! While in this game, you have to level your stamina (which after awhile becomes a waste) to only get FIVE more capacity per level! Speaking of which...-There aren't as many useful spells in this game as there were in Oblivion. *Feather's gone, which is a major setback to all those looters out there. *Chameleon is also gone, but it was exploited in Oblivion so I guess I can understand.*Light is replaced with a crappy ball of light that only lasts a minute, whether you have it floating above you or stuck somewhere.*Night eye's gone.*Cure disease/poison is gone. Now you have to lug around potions or wear equipment that gives 100% resistance to it (luckily there are quite a bit of 100% resist disease equipment out there)*Fortify health/magic/stamina is gone.There are some more but I don't wanna just rant on and on about it.-No spellmaking.I know it sounds like I'm just bagging on the game's flaws, but I am pointing out how amazing this game is. I know the game came out nearly a month ago, so there could be updates coming out, and this review could be updated accordingly. If you have the money, get this game. You will not be disappointed."
"It's kind of boring walking or horsebacking long distances, love graphics, the music, and the scenery. Well disc I got from here was a little scratched up but it works perfectly good."
Awesome game. playing takes a long time-worth the money. I could still play but after finishing the main goal I have lost interest
I bought this game after watching a friend play it. It is easy to get sucked into this game. I also love the fact that your journey through the game is very individual.
"This is it. Bethesda had finally done their homework by listening to their fans, researching into what worked and not thus far in this most complicated genre of all, what made Morrowind so much deeper and more memorable than Oblivion -- and they released what is probably their best and most consistent game yet. All things considered, it is also among the best role-playing games ever made. But Bethesda needed all their blood, sweat and tears, all the hard experience from Arena to Fallout 3 to pull this feat.Skyrim is best described as a distinctive, homogenic experience in a persistent world. I think it is best played in huge chunks, in a wide-eyed, semi-meditative state, which is a prerogative of open-world RPG's, this pinnacle genre in video gaming. I'll try to break down the best components of this experience:- As much as the vast open-world formula permits it, Bethesda creates free-roaming NPC's with true characters -- even if only some of them really stick out and even fewer are memorable. As expected, characters who are relevant to the main plot are fleshed out the most: Ulfric Stormcloak, his second-in-command Galmar, Esbern, and our clandestine associate Delphine, perhaps most of all. What is great though is that some of the less important characters end up being quite memorable too: Ancano, the mysterious Thalmor emissary in the College. Madanach, the disgruntled leader of the Forsworn. Kodlak Whitemane, the Companions' elderly foreman who even writes a lengthy diary that we can discover. And when I finally lost my loyal sidekick Lydia in some dungeon after days of doing quests together, I felt a genuine sense of emotional loss (even if she wasn't one of the more memorable NPC's), a very rare feeling in computer games.- Politics are realistic, complex, convoluted, frustrating, as they should be. The internal and external struggles of the various factions are not sugarcoated for the player, it's all laid out as it is, and we need to figure our own way around the relations. The Empire, the Thalmor, the Stormcloaks, the Forsworn, the Blades, the Greybeards -- all their destinies are intertwined in a realistic way, all have their respective agendas that the player needs to figure out with minimal to no handholding. The fact that Skyrim's political landscape is not simplified for easier digestion is one of my favorite aspects of the game. It's a subtle, mature feature not advertised with hype, yet it helps the immersion tremendously.- Many of the conversations are deep and involving -- for a Bethesda game. They are excellently written and often quite long, which is taken for granted from some other developers like Obsidian, but it's a very pleasant surprise coming from Bethesda. The crucial negotiation scene in High Hrothgar reminded me of the Castle Never trial scene in NWN2, as it achieved the same kind of tension, gravity and drama, which is absolutely awesome for a mostly non-scripted open-world role-playing game. Skyrim is probably the very first open-world RPG that lives up to the challenge posed by Obsidian's offerings in terms of dramatization and tension.- Many of the quests are creative, exhilarating and unorthodox. The main plotline is haunted by a sense of wonder and is graced by many (scripted) scenes that are bound to be remembered as some of the most memorable scenes in gaming: the first dragon hunt at the Whiterun guard tower; the reading of the Elder Scroll on the mountaintop; the dragon trapping in Dragonreach; the greet and cheer of a dozen flying dragons after the final battle. And Blackreach, a vast, eerie, otherworldly cavern with abandoned structures is one of the top 5 in-game locations i've encountered in a game EVER. Outside of actual real-life adventure travel, it is probably only open-world RPG's that are capable of achieving this sense of wonder, since it presupposes the element of boundless exploration in an intriguing region. It also presupposes a capability of sensing wonders in the players themselves, something that many jaded gamers of today seem incapable of -- in real life or virtual.- There are about 330 books in Skyrim, and while I haven't read all of them, I took the time to read quite a few. This is part of why the game is a triumph: not one of the books is shallow, boring or badly written. Sure, most of them are brief 3-4 page essays, but this has to be one of the first games that take its own book reading feature very seriously. You can spend several hours just browsing through the ingame books and not be bored. What's even better is the way the books' material ties in directly with the actual gameplay. In most RPG's, ingame books are disconnected from the actual gameplay. Here, they complement it. You can read a lot about Alduin or the Wolf Queen, for instance, and later you get to meet both of them.- Some towns are architecturally awesome and feel alive with daily bustle. Markarth and Whiterun, especially. I liked the vibe of Solitude and Riften as well. Again, this would not be such a feat in a ""hands-off"", closed-world RPG, but the fact that even towns are awesome and realistic in Skyrim makes the end product all the more irresistible.So the game is not only huge and open-ended, but it includes characters, quests, books and towns with the high quality of smaller scale closed-world games: it's the culmination of the best of both worlds, not unified successfully until now. This is what makes Skyrim a milestone and a masterpiece.I finally got fed up with all of it around the 100 hours mark. That's quite a feat as the vast majority of contemporary RPG's stop being interesting (and usually run out of material) before 40-50 hours of gameplay. At this point, I couldn't stand to endure another bandit-infested fort, another Nord village, another steampunk Dwemer ruin, another mission update and so forth. It was too much, as Skyrim's world is very homogenic. You'll find the exact same non-scripted stuff at the southern tip as on the icy Northern reaches. Thus Skyrim's geographical and thematic realism is a mixed blessing; it can get grating, repetitive, predictable. But it's a long enjoyable ride until that point.The skill system is radically simplified and streamlined, clearly the influence of mainstream console gaming (which itself is a blight on role-playing games). Much had been said about the classless system and the lack of skills like acrobatics. While all this can be interpreted as a dumbing down of game mechanics, I found that it doesn't hinder immersion, in fact maybe it promotes it: much like in a real-life adventure trip, in Skyrim all you need to really worry about is the actual surrounding environment instead of stats and dice rolls.The Skyrim province and culture is quite blatantly inspired by Medieval Scandinavia, right down to the names and the looks of the people. I wish Bethesda took a more original approach than just ""vikings on steroids"".I've used the already-famous SkyUI mod almost from day one, because I found the original UI insufferably dumbed-down and console-y. Its inventory management was so simplistic and awkward, it felt like it belongs to a lesser game.Oh, the bugs. The 1.4 patch still failed to squash a number of serious show-stoppers. But us open-world RPG fans learned years ago that a major game is considered an ""immature"" release until it lives to see its first or even second birthday. By then the inevitable barrage of official and unofficial patches will have probably helped it to thoroughly playable status. (VTM: Bloodlines and Gothic 3 are prime examples of why it is useful to wait at least 2 years after initial release.) Judging by that, I'm sure I'll return to Skyrim around 2014 for another playthrough.""We're checking [Skyrim] out aggressively. We like it. We're big admirers of [Bethesda] and the product. We think we can do some wonderful things,"" says Bioware co-founder Ray Muzyka. That has to be the ultimate praise, even if it comes from an increasingly uninspired developer that has spent the last few years spiraling down from failure (Mass Effect 2) to failure (Dragon Age 2) to sellout (The Old Republic). Here's hoping that Skyrim will change the development path of RPG's for the rest of the decade, bringing back both Obsidian and Bioware to the right track.Let's face it: Skyrim is an important moment in game history. Its success and greatness prove to the entire industry that hardcore, epic games are not only actually marketable, they are plain cooler than anything the more casual Wii/PS3 market can come up with. This is going to be a great decade for hardcore role-playing game fans."
"This is by far the best game I've played. Lots of missions, weapons, and spells. I have to give props to the artists for Bethesda, everything's down to the detail for the weapons, clothing and landscape. The world is just huge and lots to explore. If you are debating to buy it, now would be a good time. They just released update 1.5, this is the most stable it's been for me. I was able to play it for 8 hours straight (not like there's anything else to do when there's a snow blizzard in Nome, Alaska) without any lock ups. The load times seem to be a lot quicker also and brand new kill cams were you could watch yourself finish off your enemies. Hope this review proves helpful for people that are waiting for a more stable version of the game."
"I knew I would love Skyrim, because Bethesda always delivers on their Elder Scrolls franchise. The world of Tamriel is enchanting, diverse, beautiful, and deadly. Each installment thrills fans of the series and manages to draw tens of thousands of new admirers, as it has done since Morrowind. But Skyrim delivers above and beyond previous installments.A good part of the reason for this is the maturity of the technical art of videogames - Skyrim is visually amazing, and certainly the graphical prowess of the current generation of hardware, now at their zenith of programming excellence, has a lot to do with it. But beyond that, the vision of the artists shows through with unrelenting force. The world of Nordic Skyrim is so well-realized, sensitive to natural detail, and stylized after the best of ancient Nordic art that it is more than a visual treat, it is visual enchantment. It allows the player to wander through settings that have previously only looked this good in the imagination.And imagination brought to life is the key of this single-player experience, one which, despite not containing the same achievement-driven goals and real-person communication of an MMO like WoW, draws the player so relentlessly that blogs, forums and articles all over the net echo a refrain that is all too familiar to me: our lives are temporarily on hold for dozens and dozens of hours spent happily in the world of Skyrim. Crack it may be, but never have such artisans of crack unleashed such a whirlwind on the world before.In addition to wonderfully varied main and side quest missions, there are many ways to advance one's character through skill-building activities that are just plain fun - I personally love to smith armor (Elven, after the persuasion of my character), improve it to its superior form, enchant it with magical effects, and name the armor (after my character's homeland, the Summerset Isles), essentially creating an unique piece to don for my forays across the wilderness. There are many such activities readily available.I could go on, but there is enough on the internet to fill in any missed details and to further cement my opinion. There is very, very little even equivocal reactions to this game - everything is overwhelmingly positive, and I know well why this is so. Yes, there are numerous bugs, and yes, they can detract from the game, but on the whole everyone (myself included) tends to be amused and entertained rather than upset by visions of flying mammoths, NPCs standing on each others' heads, and arrows remaining stuck in a character model for weeks on end. I daresay every player has run into at least a few bugs, but those which are truly game-altering are sure to be patched within a couple weeks of the game's official release. Don't wait, though. Get it now."
"After 20+ hours I feel like I've barely scratched the surface...the environmental visuals are nothing short of breathtaking...my wife (who hates games) said it looks like a 3D movieif you played Fallout Vegas some of the mechanics will feel familiar: lock picking interface, having ""tag along"" companions who grouse when you use them as pack mules for extra gear...unlike Dragon Age 2 and Mass Effect 2, your character is mute and ""speaks"" through an interface wheel of scripted choices...in this area I much preferred Dragon Age 2's system (especially the always hilarious ""smart ass"" mode)these are minor quibbles...this is an amazing game and so far I would rate this the best RPG I have ever played...and it shows no signs of disappointing!"
"The title of this review pretty much says it all. Is it perfect? No. There are some glitches and the facial animations are a bit akward, but it is an epic game in scale, in fun, and in game design."
"Never has a game made me feel so powerful and yet small and unimportant in such a big world.  The story is good enough to play through and the graphics (once installed to harddrive) is on par with the best of them.  I'm still waiting for the 1.5 patch to come out in a couple months so I can finally marry Lydia, it also bring more kill cams with magic and archery.  The mixes of spells/archery/bladed weapons are endless and you never feel like you are doing the same thing over and over thanks to a random mission generator inside the game separate front the story for the most part.  The game is much cheaper now so pick it up if you haven't already, you will fall....and fall hard."
"No one needs to read a review written by a guy at work on a Friday at 11:47am in 2014 for Skryim. You already know what it's about and what it can do.So I'm going to go back and drop a few more notes about my review fo Cloverfield.I refused to see Cloverfield in the theatre. Every now and then I get stubborn about something and make a big scene out of boycotting it. At that moment, Cloverfield caught my wrath. I think JJ Abrams is probably a nice guy but he doesn't really do much for me and although he didn't write or direct Cloverfield his name was all over it. I eventually got bored at work one day (as will happen) and bought a used copy for like $7 of Cloverfield on DVD. I watched it that night and enjoyed it. It was a fun, monster-in-Manhattan romp around and for 7 bones it didn't break the bank.Phew, glad I got that out of the way. Now if you don't own Skyrim, go out and buy it. It's the best game of the last few years and if you really love anti-social RPGs that you can play endlessly at your own pace this is the game for you."
"I have played several RPGs (KOTOR, KOTOR 2, Mass Effect, Mass Effect 2, Fallout 3, Fallout New Vegas) and I can tell you, Bethesda did a great job bringing you into the history of Skyrim.I never played Elder Scrolls before, however I did not need to.  Honestly this was my biggest fear.The game play feels solid from the character creation all the way up to the battles and questing.This is not a game to rush through, this a game like Fallout 3 and NV, that you must take it easy and if possible not using any guides but your exploration instinct and desire of adventure.  This though will require many, many hours from you but... totally worthy even if like me you only have a couple of minutes per day (40-60) its ok, just don't rush through the main plots, do side quests, some hunting, exploring, that is the way to go with these games."
I have been playing this game for a while now and really enjoy it. There is so much to do and I don't seem to get board with it at all. I am currently only half way through the main quest because I have been having too much fun with he mages college and the thieves guild. I plan on going through the guilds and many of the other quests before I complete the main story line.This is an improvement on Elder Scrolls IV by a lot. The menu system and the game play is great!. I find that all of the annoying time consuming activities in IV are resolved/corrected in Skyrim. It seems that I spend less time doing things I don't like and more time mastering the things I like ie different skills that are available. Anyone that enjoys a single player RPG should defiantly not hesitate purchasing this.
"I love this game. If you like other Bethesda games like fallout or oblivion, you will love this game! I recommend it!"
"When this game came out last year I wasn't too excited for it. Having played the previous Elder Scrolls games and the frustration that comes with them, this game did not appeal to me.Well when Christmas 2011 came along this was given to me as a gift. I put it in my Xbox and began playing it. Not 30 minutes later and I was stunned in amazement. The quality of the graphics, the voice acting, the combat and the DRAGONS had my jaw hitting the floor so many times that it was starting to bruise. I could not quit playing this game. Having taken off work the week for the holidays I had plenty of time to spend in Skyrim. I was so involved in the story line that I lost track of time. I knew I had been playing a while, but did not realize that I had played a full 36 hours straight. That's how amazing this experience was for me. They should have put a warning on the box that reads ""Warning"" Time Loss may Occur"" or something like that LOL.A year later and I'm still playing it, and I still love it. I have put nearly 300 hours into it. The DLC that has came out in the last year is just as amazing as the rest of the game. The open world and endless quests have kept me coming back again and again. It's as about as ""realistic"" that a Fantasy game can get. If you are looking for a game that oozes awesomeness this is the game for you. You'll battle the Undead, Wild Animals, Witches, Demons, and of course DRAGONS. I mean who doesnt like going into battle with a enormous Fire/Ice breathing Dragon?This is now my favorite game of all time. I do still play a variety of other games but this is my go to when I have nothing to do.I know most people own or have played it by now but if you are new and have doubts, I'm telling you trust me and go for it. You will not be disappointed."
"Bethesda Game Studios have done it again - they produced another masterpiece. The dialog and the combat systems of Skyrim are dated, but the immense photo-realistic open game world, the riveting stories, and the rich contents, typical of The Elder Scrolls series, are all present. Skyrim is a place where a gamer can lose himself and live a different life. However, there is a potentially game stopping anomaly in the game that a gamer should be aware of - the difficulty setting of the game. I started out the game at the novice level with my Xbox 360. From level 1 to level 5, the game was relatively easy; my character got killed a number of times, mainly due to my ineptitude with the controls, but I got better and better every day. Then from level 5 to level 12, the game inexplicably became immensely more difficult, as if I was at the master level, even though I was at the novice level from the start. My character got killed every minute or so by enemies much, much stronger. There were times at which I couldn't go on with a mission because of immensely more powerful enemies. I had to back track to earlier saves. Then somewhere in the middle of level 12, the game got easy again. It was night and day (See Note). I killed dragons with a couple of firebolts and a few swings of my sword. I am aware of the new leveling system of Skyrim, where the NPCs do not level with the player character, but it doesn't explain what I experienced. For example, the strength of a pack of wolves should be the same at all levels. At level 3, when the game was easy, I dispatched the wolves with a few swings. However, at level 10, when the game was difficult, the wolves ate my lunch - one bite and half of my health was gone, another bite and my character was dead. In the meantime, I managed to make a couple of swings at one wolf and it hardly flinched, and I was surrounded by three. The wolves were not this powerful at level 3; why were they so powerful at level 10? I can't explain this; it has to be a software glitch.Another thing I like to mention is the interest in Skyrim as expressed by Ray Muzyka, CEO and co-founder of BioWare, whose latest work was Dragon Age II. He was quoted saying, ""We're checking [Skyrim] out aggressively. We like it. We're big admirers of [Bethesda] and the product. We think we can do some wonderful things."" Wow, just imagine - a game with the advanced dialog wheel and the spectacular combat systems of Dragon Age II, and the immense open game world and riveting stories of Skyrim. It would be gamers' heaven.Note: To be specific, the difficulty seemed to return to the novice level after I interrupted the Skyrim game to play another. This involved removing the Skyrim disc and replacing with another game disc at the Xbox 360. When I returned to Skyrim, the difficulty level might have reset itself."
"As many other have said, this game has amazing graphics, countless hours of content, thousands of items to discover, and can be played according to your personal taste. These are all true and it may be the best action RPG of the generation.That being said, casual gamers (how I would describe my level of commitment)who only use their XBOX to kill a couple hours here and there might find this game tiresome. You may very well hate it. Skyrim follows the standard RPG formula, where you start of with a character destined to be a hero, who has the hit points and combat ability of an infant. Basically, a lamb at a wolf convention. You then grind away for hours, killing whatever you meet because every organism in an RPG world hates you, complete a few quest, and are rewarded by reaching the point where you can kill a dragon by flexing your bicep. This makes for a long game and allows you to make many decisions that result in your super character being a reflection of how you like play. However, if you can only commit a few hours here and there, it could take you months to get out of weakling levels. Games like this are far more enjoyable when you can readily dispatch most of the standard NPC enemies and that point can be a long time coming.Skyrim makes this process a bit more difficult than most games, because in an effort to create a truly open world environment, enemies are not grouped by difficulty. You can find bandits that are appropriate foes for a low level player near hard dungeons and giants that can kill you in one hit right next to your first quest. Even if you follow the story quest path in the game, you will find enemies that are well above your skill level, so what is supposed to be a journey of improving your character become a game of ""find the exploit"", in which you look for ways to kill them that take advantage of oversights in AI programming.On the rest of the review, the game loses a star for me for two reasons.1. Being Completely Unoriginal: This is your standard issue, cookie cutter, RPG setting taken from the pages of Tolkien and the works of European mythology that inspired him. The whole gang is here including elves, dwarves, vikings, dragons, anthropomorphic cat people, giants, mammoths, wolves, werewolves, giants rats (really, we have reached the point where Dragon Age Origins made an in game joke about giant rats being in every RPG and they still the stupid things in Skyrim), skeletons, vampires, etc. The story is decently written, but you could switch it out for the The Hobbit and the only thing that would change would be your characters feet getting hairier. Granted this is the Elder Scrolls series, but there has to be a way to mix it up by game five.To put in perspective how standard this story is, it reminded me a lot of Aidyn Chronicles: The First Mage, a 2001 game for N64. Ten years later, only the graphics have changed.2. Long loading times: Almost every door you walk through includes a loading screen. That may not seem like much, but then you try to explore and town and spend half your game time waiting every time you want to enter a shack.In conclusion, an awesome game full of standard content that needs to be approached with the same mindset as personally remodeling your house. Be sure you level of commitment matches the project before opening your wallet."
"So, i only played a bit of oblivion, and i didn't understand the hype behind skyrimbut then i played it!! its great!! many things you can do, you could level without even doing the main quest line, i highly recommend this game!! i havent had any bugs so i love this game to death XD"
"i have been playing the elder scrolls since 95 and have played every single elder scrolls game (even shadow key)I preorder skyrim and played around 1,500 hours or so.  i know the game pretty well.MY REVIEWafter playing around 40 hours Or so it felt as if bethesda went too mainstream and tried to make Skyrim something oblivion or morrowind or dagger fall was  not.it just didn't feel like a elder scrolls game.  the classic RPG elements were gone and i hardly could tell i was playing a elder scrolls game.  The story was not  as immenseas oblivions or morrowinds.  while the game is stunning graphically graphics don't count.  the storyline does.  while the main quest sucks there are many good secondary quests to choose from .  The game feels as if bethesda dumped every  good thing from previous games and  made this without the common lore or storys that i fell in love in the previous TES games.  i gave 4 stars for several reasons i will go over the pros and consPROS AND CONSPROS -  graphics are stunningwell organized combat and level up systemdecent side questsConsfeels more like a action adventure game more than a western RPGmain quest is dullglitchy buggy and freeze a lotOveral if you want a real TES game go with oblivion for the 360  i have played over 4,000 hours on oblivion and its worth it"
"What can I say? This is Game of The Year!PROS:- This is how a REAL RPG should be designed, developed and executed like Skyrim.- The sounds and graphics are stunning...they are breathless most of the time. I literally feel like I am in this game.- The races/classes and leveling are way better then the previous Elder Scrolls. I'm glad they made it flexible.- The main story line and misc. quests are all fun. Some give great weapons, gold or unlock other mysteries of the game.CONS:- GLITCHES. I've ran into a lot of glitches. Hitting ""B"" and opening the main menu, talking to people, graphic 2d/3d textures, and running into white/blue screens. This game as also frozen multiple times on me. It's not polished like I hoped. It's a bummer but it's true. Hopefully down the road a solid patch or patches will fix the issues. If they do, well I will change my ratings to a 5/5 but for now it's a 4/5 rating game.CONCLUSION:Best RPG this year and maybe for a few years down the road. Overall this game is excellent and is a must buy!UPDATE:DATE: 3/18/2013I've owned this game for over 17 months and it's still solid! Also, the patches have fixed a lot of the glitches. It has also improved performance. Because of this, I believe this is a 5/5 star rating game now.P.S: If you get a chance...buy the DLC's. They are worth the money in my opinion. It's a game that never ends!"
Game arrived quickly with no scratches and i was excited to play it but i got bored with it quick. There are lots of quests and plenty of things yo do but everything takes forever. I looked up a video online and there looked to be a 75 different cities. I played for probably close to 24 hours in total and i only walked through 8. I also didnt like not being able to sell all the stuff i picked up. The market runs out of money fast. There is plenty of stuff to do in the game but it is not for me.
"The Elder Scrolls games are my favorite series. They are the only games I know of that have all the features I want. First, you get to customize a lot more than in other games. You get to choose a name for your character, choose a race (fictional groups), customize his/her face, and change clothing during the game. Second, there are tons of weapons you can use, like bows, swords, maces, and more, or you can use a large variety of magic. Third, it's a real open-world game where you go at your own pace, walk around a large map, and do whatever you want. There is a main storyline you can do if you want, but you don't have to, and there are many side quests you can do or pass up as well. There are organizations (guilds) you could join or you can journey alone. As you progress, you customize your skills too. Do you want to specialize more in sneak attacks, like an assassin, or in more regular battle skills and sword action, or perhaps you prefer magic instead of conventional weapons? Even within the study of magic you can concentrate your skills on healing or destruction, among other choices. Another thing is that with one of the DLCs you can even build your own house. You can even get married or stay single in this game. You can be a `bad guy' killing random, innocent people, or a `good guy' helping people by defeating random thugs you encounter.  So I like this game because it's the most customizable game I know of and it's the most open-world as well, with a large map and many side quests.The game has good graphics that you expect, but I wish they were a bit better. They look as good as other games out right now, but since this is my favorite game I wish it had the absolute best graphics. I think maybe Gears of War might have the best graphics out right now (even though I don't like that game), but this game doesn't have as good of graphics as that, but they are still fairly good though.All these games are about the same but slightly different. The way you progress your skills is slightly different in this game compared to Oblivion. The main difference in this game is the new feature of learning Dragon words, which you can use as a special power. In this game, you are in the northern province of Skyrim, where it is cold and snowy, but there are some beautiful green areas as well. Skyrim's main population is the Nords (in this game, they remind me more of Celtic or German peoples), but you'll find all the usual Tamriel races up there too.I am sort of disappointed with the weapons. They are the same and work as good as in Oblivion, mostly, but I was hoping there would be more different weapons made from new materials. For example, there is a glass sword, like last time, but why can't there be a diamond sword or something new? There are some new surprises, like moon enchanted weapons, or whatever those are, but that will be left to be discovered. I also don't like how you can only wear one ring instead of wearing a ring on both hands. They got rid of the chameleon spells, and just kept the invisibility spells. This is good because the chameleon spells were unnecessary. And in this one, you can't turn invisible as easily, or at least I can't yet, like I did in Oblivion (felt like I was cheating a bit turning invisible when there was too much danger).This game is almost appropriate for all ages, it never using the 'S' or 'F' word, it doesn't even use other 'bad language', and sexual themes are more romantic than sexual and they are very tasteful and discrete, or more innuendo type. Like all games, the graphics aren't good enough to show enough violence, so this game doesn't have that much violence. It has more heroic battles. The dark brotherhood is rather dark, but even with their missions, you go out and assassinate people that are consider bad people to most people. There are werewolves, vampires, and some fairly dark wizards. Unlike Oblivion there aren't any random zombies walking around, now you can turn a dead person into a zombie instead, but they look mostly like how they did when they were alive.I like the medieval type theme, my favorite, but I wish there were other games too that had a different theme yet still included all the customizable features of this game, like a cowboy theme or a futuristic theme. No other game compares to this series, only once I played a Star Wars RPG video-game that was sort close to the rank of this game, but now the new Stars Wars games aren't very good anymore. So this game is the best, until there is another Elder Scrolls with better graphics."
"....How I love it. Man who doesn't love this game? I mean I never get tired, and come Chirstmas, I take it that I won't be doing much sleeping? =D"
"(If this seems too complicated, you can find videos of this glitch on YouTube by searching for ""Skyrim Alchemy Glitch"".)Things to collect:For Alchemy, get as many of these items as you can because you'll have to make the same potions several times in a row.  Potions only need 2 items to be made, but the different options make creating these potions easier because some of these ingredients are hard to find.Fortify Restoration potion requires any 2 of the following items;Abecean Longfin, Cryodilic Spadetail, Salt Pile, Small Antlers, Small Pearl.Fortify Enchanting potion requires any 2 of the following items;Blue Butterfly Wing, Hagraven Claw, Snowberries, Spriggan Sap.Fortify Smithing potion requires any 2 of the following items;Blisterwort, Glowing Mushroom, Sabre Cat Tooth, Spriggan Sap.Search Alchemy vendors to get ingredients faster; there is one in every major city.  You can get the fish you need just by swimming up to fish and catching them.Snowberries grow in a lot of places where it's covered in snow, but you'll find them easily just by walking around Dawnstar.Blue Butterfly Wings can be found by harvesting the butterflies in the plains outside of WhiterunFor Disenchanting you need:One enchanted item that ""Fortifies Alchemy""Anything else that is already Enchanted.  (Ideally you want an item that fortifies health, one that fortifies stamina, and one that fortifies magic.)It is going to be important to Disenchant as many things as you can prior to enchanting your armor and weapons.  While this destroys the weapon or armor you disenchanted, it teaches your character what they need to know to enchant anything.For Enchanting:Armor without enchantment2 Helmets without enchantment2 Gloves, Gauntlets, or Bracers without enchantmentBoots without enchantment2 Rings (any kind) without enchantment2 Necklaces (any kind) without enchantmentAs many filled Soul Gems as you can find (Greater, Grand, or Black Soul Gems are best).  You'll need one for every enchanted item you make.  Many vendors have these gems for sale.Prior to making potions it would be best to activate Perks on the Alchemy, Enchanting, and Smithing perk trees.  High level in these skills isn't necessarily required, and the act of performing this glitch with likely max the levels on these three aspects.However, if you intend to Smith your own Armor to be enchanted, you will want to make sure you've activated enough stars in your Smithing perk tree for the type of armor you want to make.  Also, be aware of what is required to make the armor you want (i.e. type of Ingots, Leather, Leather Strips, etc...)Smithing isn't really necessary, because without further training your character can already smith Iron Armor.  Once you apply enchantments to your armor and weapons they will be so powerful that their type becomes irrelevant.Arcane Enchanter, Alchemy Table, and Smithing equipment are all easy accessible in Windhelm.  If you just arrived in Windhelm, turn left and run as far as you can.  In this market area you'll find a Smith, an Arcane Enchanter in the SW corner, and an Alchemy store called The White Phile which has an Alchemy table inside.Also, if you have bought a home, many large homes will have an Arcane Enchanter and Alchemy Table if you've bought the appropriate decorating package.Save the game NOW!1. Use the Arcane Enchanter to Disenchant all the magical items whose ability you want to apply to different item(s) later.  You MUST disenchant something that ""Fortifies Alchemy"".  It is important that you have learned ""Fortify Magic"", ""Fortify Health"", and ""Fortify Stamina"".  If you have not learned those enchantments, you can still do steps 1-10, but will have to learn those enchantments before finishing the steps.2. Use the Arcane Enchanter to Enchant; 1 Helmet (or other headwear), 1 set of Gloves, Gauntlets, or Bracers, 1 ring, and 1 Necklace with the ""Fortify Alchemy"" Enchantment.3. Now, remove all apparel you're currently wearing, and put on the 4 items you've just enchanted.4. Go to the Alchemy table and mix any 2 of these items (Abecean Longfin, Cryodilic Spadetail, Salt Pile, Small Antlers, Small Pearl) to make 1 ""Fortify Restoration"" potion.5. Back off the Alchemy table, Drink the potion you just made, then go to your apparel menu and remove the 4 enchanted items, then put them back on (don't ask me why).6. Next, repeat steps 4 and 5, 7-10 times.  Every time you do this you should note that the percentage of improvement increases on your 4 pieces of ""Fortify Alchemy"" apparel.  The amount of time you should repeat this step will vary depending on how skilled you were when you originally enchanted those items.  But the goal is to not over do this.  If you see the numbers getting way too big, you may cause the game to crash.  Be careful, if necessary, reload the game from the last save and start over.By now your Fortify Alchemy skill is really high because the repeated use of the ""Fortify Restoration"" potion has multiplied the effectiveness of the Alchemy apparel you're wearing.  Make sure your 4 enchanted items are equipped, and then return to the table.7. Now create as many ""Fortify Enchanting"" potions as you can by mixing any 2 of these items; Blue Butterfly Wing, Hagraven Claw, Snowberries, Spriggan Sap.Don't back out of Alchemy.8. Now create as many ""Fortify Smithing"" potions as you can by mixing any 2 of these items; Blisterwort, Glowing Mushroom, Sabre Cat Tooth, Spriggan Sap.Now you've created all the potions you need to make yourself a God, but if you want to, feel free to take this opportunity to make any other potions you can.  Because your Alchemy is fortified, any potion you create will be worth a lot of Gold.  So much so that no vendor would ever have enough, but if you want to be able to sell one thing and take all their money this is an easy way to do it.NOTE: speechcraft perks allow you to invest 500 gold in every store which will give the vendor 500 more to barter with.  There is also a speechcraft perk that gives vendors an extra 1000 Gold!  If you have those perks, the vendors will have 1750-2500 gold every 24 hours.Skip steps 9 and 10 if you don't intend to build or improve weapons.9. If you are going to smith your own weapons, make sure you have the right amount and type of ingots and leather before attempting.  Go to the forge and create your weapons and armor, do NOT drink the fortify smithing potion before doing that, it will not help you there.10. When your done creating weapons and armor, go to either the grindstone or the workbench.  Drink 1 fortify smithing potion, and improve your weapons and armor.  Keep in mind that improvements require additional ingots and leather.  Also, the potion you drank is only good for 30 seconds, so be careful not to take too long, other wise back out, drink another potion and do it again.  If you've done this right, you should have smithed both your armor and weapons up to a decent level of damage.  (i.e. Iron Dagger = 201 Damage)11. Next, head to the Arcane Enchanter.  Before doing this, you need to understand that only certain items can do certain things.  If you need to know what enchantments can apply to a specific item, go into the enchanter, and start the process by selecting the item you want to enchant.  When you go down to ""enchantment"" many things will be blacked out, meaning they cannot apply to that item, or you haven't learned that enchantment yet.Once you know what enchantments you want to apply to each item, back out of the enchanter, drink one fortify enchanting potion, then QUICKLY enchant 1 item.  Your potion is only good for 30 seconds, that's why you need to know what you're trying to do before you do it!If you pulled that off, your item will either have a serious magic damage attached to it, or your armor will have a wicked rating on it.Drink 1 potion and repeat this process for every item you want to enchant!Enchanting suggestions;Enchant a ring with Fortify StaminaEnchant a Necklace with Fortify HealthEnchant your Gloves, Gauntlets, or Bracers with Fortify MagicEnchant your Boots with Fortify CarryIf you've done at least those 4 things, you most likely will be invincible, have pratically unlimited magic, stamina so good you can RUN all the way across Skyrim, and the carrying capacity to move thousands or millions of lbs!Feel free to enchant your weapons however you see fit.  But keep in mind; this will probably make the weapon so strong it will kill anything with 1 strike!  So it might not be as fun.How to fast level certain skills.Speechcraft.Travel to Riftin and speak to the barkeeper at the Black Briar Meadery.  He will present an option to persuade him to tell more about Maven Black Briar.  Take this option, it will keep presenting itself.  You can basically make him repeat the same thing until you max out your speechcraft.Sneak.Find a location in a city near some people, go into sneak, then set your controller with rubber bands so your characters just sneaks in circles for about an hour.  As long as you are somewhat close to NPC's and in sneak your skill will level without you needing to do much of anything.  FYI, Xbox controller will sleep after 15 minutes, so check on it occasionally.Pickpocket.In Windhelm you'll find a beggar name Silda the Unseen.  She can sell you pickpocket training.  Buy one session, sneak around behind her, and steal the money back for an additional skill increase.  Save every time you do this because sometimes you'll get caught.  She can train you 5 times, and if you steal your money back you'll get another 5 increases.  Then when you go through another character level up you can repeat this process.  Though eventually this option will stop presenting itself.Combat and Destruction MagicIf you join the Dark Brotherhood you will eventually get a horse named Shadowmere.  Shadowmere has health that regenerates very quickly and he will not attack you, so you can attack him repeatedly using One-Handed, Two-Handed, Archer, and Destruction Magic and level up without actually being attacked.ConjurationWhile traveling near the bottom of a steep hill or mountain, if you are attacked by any creature, try to move up the steep incline.  Your character can usually get up higher than your attacker.  Once you're in a location where they can't hit you, cast ""Bound Sword"" repeatedly.  You have to be currently under attack for conjuration to level up, so having someone actively trying to get at you is essential.  Keep a lot or magic potions on you so you don't have to stop.BlockYou can do this in pretty much the same manner as conjuration.  Just block with a sword or shield while being attacked, if your health get's too low, move back up the steep incline on the hill or mountain until you're healed, or use potions.  Then come down again and let them hit you some more.  Doing this with a low level enemy like a wolf would be best.Free goodies can be found in a secret chest in Dawnstar.  Fast travel to Dawnstar, if you haven't discovered it yet, you can pay a carriage operator to take you there.  There are two mines in this town.  Find Iron Breaker Mine.  Do not enter it.  Just to the left of the entrance there are 3 rocks.  Place your reticle in that location and eventually you see an option to ""Search Chest"" even though there isn't anything visible in that spot.  The chest is teeming with goodies, empty it.  It is supposed to refresh every 2-10 game days, so check it out whenever you're in the area."
"Dragons.Swords.Axes.Pointy helmets.Snowy mountains.Shouting at people.Mudcrabs.Great music.Drinking mead.Waist-length beards.Irish Wolfhounds.Giant castles.'Nuff said, Skyrim is awesome."
"I got Skyrim yesterday and I must say, it is full of action and visually stunning. You can tell the people who made this game put a lot of work into it. I haven't played Oblivion so I can't really compare the two, but so far I've put in over 10 hours into the game and I've barely even scratched the surface of the story. There are so many towns to visit and so many quests to do and dragons to slay. The game froze only once so far, but that's not a big problem if you are constantly saving. My character also got stuck one time which made me laugh.  The shouts are amazing though, especially the shout which lets you speed travel. You can even buy your own horse to ride and you can even get a companion who is sworn to serve you forever. You really never know what you are going to run into in this game. I definitely suggest saving often. There's just so much to do. I definitely would recommend this game to anyone who loves to travel across huge landscapes, traversing forest, mountain, or valley because sometimes it can take so long to get from one place to another. However, once you've discovered a place you can instantly transport back to it in an instant using the map. The reason why I'm giving the game four stars is only because of the freezing and getting stuck I've encountered so far and because of other glitches that people have encountered and mentioned in their reviews. Other than that, this game blew me away...Okay, I'm going to back to playing now, I'm on a mission to obtain secret documents from a party in the city of Solitude and the best part is I'll be attending as a guest. Muhahahaha...(maniacal laughter dies down)..."
"Since most people that come to this page won't even see my review, I won't strain myself by typing as much as I've seen others do.This is an amazing game, not just for TES fans, but newbs to RPGs in general. Actually, anyone that can sit down and enjoy videogames would enjoy Skyrim. There's just so much to do, so many places to vist, and people to talk to, everyone will find their thing in this game."
"This game is amazing!! The wait was well worth what we got here. I just hate having to share it with my husband, looks like he's getting the PC version for Christmas, or his own xbox! Graphics are amazing, the characters are great...I love that some of them sound like Arnold Schwarzenegger, lol. I don't have time to write a detailed review right now, but I wanted to give it my five stars because it really deserves it. I only wish I had no life so I could stay home and play this all day!"
my 12yr. old son really enjoys this game.  A &#34;had to have&#34;... b/c his friend had it & a must for his game collection as well.
"Rated M (mature 17 +) - language and graphics.  Great game, fighting dragons, finding the elder scrolls and much more.  Great shipper, seller and price.  Thanks"
"Like all the TES games, this one just kicks ass & is tons of fun to play.My only complaint about it is the damn dragons... every time you turn a corner theres a stupid dragon there killing villagers & stuff... which would be fine except they never go away. Not even when you finish the main quest... which is odd, because thats supposed to be the whole point of the main quest.The trick is to never take the main quest until you're ready to be harassed by dragons every 10 minutes."
"""Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim"" is frankly the most detailed and immersive game I have ever seen. This was the one game my son ""had to have"" as a reward for solid weekend of backbreaking labor and after seeing some 20 or more hours of a fascinating storyline, rich world environment, fantastic graphics, and great user customizable features, it is easy to see why.You start off by selecting a character race and appearance, and then dive right in the adventure as a ""Dragonborn"". Your character can interact with dozens of detailed non-player characters, fight all sorts of fantastic creatures (including dragons, fairly early on), help shape the political landscape of the realm, acquire wealth and weapons, and develop your fighting and arcane skills.The general game controls are good and very usable but the inventory system is somewhat more cumbersome than need be, especially during the combat segments. The graphics and attention to detail in the environment are truly impressive and are almost worth the cost of the game alone (I can't even begin to imagine the time and effort required to create this world).This is truly an impressive game!Highly Recommended!CFH"
"We all know 2011 is great for games. Gears of War 3, Battlefield 3, Dark Souls, MGS HD Collection, Forza 4, Call o' dooty, Batman: Arkham City, Zelda:SS, etc (I can go on forever), but, this game.THIS. GAME...takes the cake.The highest rated game this year, with over 60 reviews and NOT ONE UNDER 90%? Holy hell!This game will consume your life. That is all."
"This is a great game, it goes on forever, theres always something to do and see, and you can even have different people fight along side of you during the game.  5 stars for the gameplay, graphics, and fun aspect and you can pretty much go anywhere in the game."
Terrific game. Huge terrific game. Enormous. You better have hours upon hours of free time to play this wonderful game.
after playingh oblivion i decided i would always play the elder scrolls games. i have all the dlc thats out so far and its always worth it to extend the best game you might ever play.
"The game, of course, was great. The item was shipped on time and in perfect condition. Best Christmas present to have gotten a teenage boy. Keeps him occupied. He still plays it as well."
Fantastic game. How many hours can you be sucked in and not even realise how much time has passed? well if you ever want to find out play this game. one of the best modern rpgs out there.
"Not many games can do what Skyrim does: allow you to feel like you're a real character in a game whose actions and decisions matter. That's the allure of this game for me. I've only played about fifteen hours or so, but I've already got stories that I share with my friends as if they were part of my personal history. And even better, the makes makes these episodes challenging enough to make one feel like he has achieved something significant. Here are just a couple of examples that make Skyrim come alive for me:My character approaches a fort on the way to rescue Gray-Mane with a follower he picked up in Whiterun. Wondering whether the mages patrolling the walls are friendly, I stroll up, ready to say hi, and get fried by five different flame spells. Reload. This time, the approach is stealthy, and from a hidden route. Sneak an arrow shot for double damage and one mage goes down. However, the others are now on the alert. Move my hiding spot, take aim, and another sneak attack produces another dead mage. But now they've seen me, and three more are sprinting toward me. Fire rune on the ground takes one out, and then I and my follower close on the remaining two using shield and swords real up close like to make these wussy mages fell uncomfortable. The approach cleared, now it's time to explore the inside. Sneaking, two more arrow shots kill two more mages, and down into the depths of the fort I go. Things are quiet. My companion says, ""I don't like the look of this."" And she's right. We meet an overpowered storm mage and her cronies that kill us about half a dozen times. Finally, I employ a smart enough strategy to succeed. Sneaking, I remove all the henchmen in the chamber, until only the storm mage is left. Then I take my sneak shot at her, and when she runs to attack, I use a special power I picked up earlier that lets me raise all the dead bodies in the vicinity. With this army and my companion, we rush the storm mage...who quickly disintegrates every undead I had sent at her. Taking heavy damage, my companion and I manage to make her fall back to create room to shoot her spells. We're hitting her with every melee strike, but she's not close to dying, and I am. In a full on suicidal rush, we force her through a door, hear a loud CLACK, and a spiked door slams into her back, killing her instantly. I literally was screaming at the TV, pumping my fist, and cursing that damn storm mage to an eternity of video game hell.Even walking through the mountains is dangerous if you're not a high enough level. After being mauled by a sabre tooth snow tiger five times, I finally stalked it before it spotted me and made the kill.This is a game I you won't want to stop playing. It's difficult enough to provide the exciting challenge of actually having to devise a strategy for the enemies and scenarios you face. There's nothing better to see your strategy succeed, and it was all your own, not one dictated by the construct of the game. And it's not punishing difficulty, like Demon Souls, where you have to go back and start from the beginning each and every time, so it doesn't get too frustrating. And the whole time, you're playing your character the way you might act if you lived in a fantasy realm. That's what you can't beat.All in all, my favorite game of all time, so far."
"This is one of my favorite games ever. People have said a lot about this game. I don't have much to add, honestly. Its a fun game if you're into mages, and monsters and dragons and stuff. Its pretty cool.It does get repetitive. For instance, about 60% of the game is spent wandering around caves that all look the same, fighting the same types of bad guys. All the people in the different towns say the same things to you over and over again. It gets old. And you have to access the menus way too much in my opinion. Those are only minor gripes though, and they shouldn't keep you from playing this game.Be prepared to grind, as well, or do some glitching to get your character where you want him to be. If you choose to be honest and just grind away, say goodbye to your social life. It takes forever! I honestly cheated the second time I played through, and had a lot more fun doing it.Great game here. One of the best ever. But really, really, repetitive. When you're done playing and you've moved along, you'll be really happy you did."
"Warning: minor spoilers (not plot-related).I had been waiting a long time to play Skyrim and I must say that all the hype was indeed justified; for once! It is complicated reviewing an RPG of this incredible depth. So first I committed myself to play for over 80 hours before I sat down to write a review. It has been difficult to put the game aside and find the time to write this review, it is that good.To give you some background, I played Oblivion and Fallout 3 to exhaustion and dabbled with Morrowind. In Skyrim I'm almost at level 39 with over 160 locations discovered and some 20 quests finished. I haven't being doing many quests really; I have focused mainly on exploring. There are over 350 main locations and a plethora of other unmarked locations just to give you an idea. I've been playing at Master level since the very beginning and I highly recommend playing at this difficulty setting. Only below level 6 did I have to tweak down the difficulty level at times to face a tough opponent (i.e. Master Vampire).As a quick run down:Is it better than Oblivion? Yes, hands down. It is more ""mature"" and has a Morrowind-esque feeling to it which Oblivion lacked. A return to its classical TES roots. More on that in the pros section.Better than Fallout 3? Mmm hard to say. Maybe marginally.Is it better than Dark Souls? Yes, but its a completely different game.Better than The Witcher 2? Yes.Is it better than DA2? Ha ha ha. Do you really need to ask this?Has it been dumbed down? Yes and no. Rather than using this ugly expression, let us just say they've ""streamlined"" gameplay to enhance it rather than detract from it. DA2, for example, dumbed-down gameplay without achieving what Bethesda has -successfully- done. The decisions that have been taken are for the better to make gameplay smoother so as to speak. To remove, for example, athletics (so you are not jumping constantly around like a nutter to increase your skill-level), to remove the Oblivion hammer system which forced you to hotkey a hammer to repair your armour and weapons after every single fight feel like appropriate changes that help the game move forward.However, I'm unsure the removal of armour pieces was a good idea. In Oblivion you had 6 body armour pieces (which was already simplified from Morrowind, mind you) and this has been trimmed down to only 4 in Skyrim (helmet, armour, boots and gauntlets).As a sidenote, if you were ever a fan of Conan of Cimmeria -like me- you will feel at home with Skyrim's artwork. It's almost a childhood dream coming true as many of the scenarios, dungeons, caves etc look right out a comic book of the Savage Sword of Conan or one of Robert E. Howard's books.Pros1. Graphics are very much improved. To the point that it feels realistic at times. In third-person view it has great visuals. Skyrim has in many instances a Dragon Age Origins-esque feeling to its graphics which I love. One of the most realistic-looking graphics for an RPG I've ever played. Totally immersive. I miss however the beautiful dawns and dusks from Oblivion which in Skyrim seem to have been neglected for some odd reason. In Oblivion I used to climb a high mountain just to see a beautiful dusk sunset. Particularly impressive are the way in which Dragons are rendered. They move and act almost life-like. Forget Oblivion's Akatosh avatar in the final fight. More on that below.2. Dragons! By far surpasses what we saw in Dragon Age Origins. When you look at them flying with the sun from behind, you actually get to see the detailed wing membranes. The way they move, roar and attack is most impressive. The music when you are in the midst of battling them is very rousing, epic like. Each and every battle is unexpected and can happen anywhere at any time. The first class of dragons are easy to kill even at Master level. Things get complicated when type B make their appearance (Blood dragons). And when you think you've finally mastered the fine art of dragon-killing along come type C (Elder dragons): run for your life. I forge my own armour and weapons. I have a master smithing skill level (100) (plus I drink a blacksmith potion to further enhance my weapon-making by 40%) AND I smith using enchanted gauntlets with eminent smithing spell (smithing is increased by 20%). Bottomline my gear is all very much improved at legendary status and even so Elder dragons kill me with a single blow blow, or with one fire breath. I even have enchanted gear like shields which give 60% protection to fire and boots that give you 30% protection but even so these dragons kill me with one blow. Unlike Oblivion, elemental protection level is capped at 85%. So it doesn't matter if your gear gives you 100pc protection against fire, the limit is set at 85%. After memorable battles a dragon may drop some top-class gear i.e. Ebony armour or a special axe that sends Daedra of up to level 12 back to Oblivion.3. Kudos to Bethesda art team. Everything looks so Scandinavian, so Viking like. Immersion is great, a big thank you. The game grows on you as you play.4. The perks system is a killer. Why didn't they do this before? The 18 skill-set is divided among the three major constellations (Warrior, Mage and Thief). A lot of thought has been put in the correct positioning of these skills. For example, light armor is appropriately in the frontier between the Warrior and Thief constellation and alchemy is in the frontier betwwen Thief and Mage. The perk system is yet another influence from Fallout 3. There are so many good ones to choose from, over 200. And you can only choose 80 of them as the level cap is at around 80 (soft cap at level 50).5. I love the new lock-picking mini-game reminiscent of Fallout 3.6. The magical effects (fire, ice, lightning etc) look truly awesome. I love how after a fight you can see the smolders or ice on walls, floor and even on snow. Makes it realistic.7. Almost every glaring flaw from Oblivion has been vastly improved upon if not completely removed. The levelling is now correct, the NPC faces are much improved if not perfect, the voice acting is varied (70 plus voice actors as opposed to Oblivions dozen), there are no facial close-up zooms whilst on dialogue, items in rooms re-arrange themselves after a while on re-entering the area unlike in Oblivion. This is very good as pots and swords were accidentally pushed on the floor while moving and it was very upsetting to see them out of place for the next hundreds of hours.8. Special mention on improvement goes to dungeon-design. They are now unique and amazing, unlike the copy-paste Oblivion dungeons. The traps are very devious. To give you an example, stealthing down a stair case I saw a pressure plate in the middle and holes on the left wall. I laughed and mentally criticised the designers for being so blatant. I avoided the trap by sticking myself to the right wall, which was cast in shadows. As it turns out this shadowy part had yet another unseen trap, which I triggered, and as I was moving on stealth mode (slowly) got killed instantly. It was impossible to see this second trap unless you equipped a torch or used a magic light. The designers had designed this second trap to catch you unawares on evading the first one (floor pressure plate). Very devious.9. Fallout 3 has cast a long shadow. In Skyrim you will appreciate a lot of its -good- influence. Examples of this are cinematic finishing moves (brilliant), crafting your own food, smithing (workbench), companions, perks, opening lock mini-game, familiar sound on discovering a new location etc. Workbenches are particularly good as they get you involved in the game and contribute to immersion.10. Influences from Peter Jackson's Lord of the Rings trilogy is evident throughout; specially in Whiterun hold. Even the music score at times resembles that of LOTR.11. Influences from George R.R. Martin's books are evident: Woolly mammoths with giants as herdsmen, wights, dragons, a civil war blighting the land. Sounds familiar? I'm unsure if this was because George R.R. Martins representatives approached Bethesda to make a conversion of A Song of Ice and Fire which was finally undertaken -unsucessfully- by developer Cyanide. There are even in-game easter eggs referring to the series with book's names such as ""A Dance with Fire"".12. Companions! They are now like in Fallout 3. They can carry gear (pack mules) and accept basic commands. Occasionally the banter is adequate.13. Some excellent unique moments exploring. The game constantly rewards getting out of your way to explore and i.e. climbing up to difficult high ridges you may find hidden cool weapons and gear.14. Plenty of memorable unique moments. i.e. you are crossing a chasm over a log and suddenly a bloody bandit archer is throwing arrows at you from the opposite end. You cannot go back and you cannot jump off unless you want to die by the fall. So you are pinned down and forced to win the fight swiftly using a bow or else die. Another example, first encounter with a wispmother. You are at first looking in awe, like an idiot, at the beautiful lights gliding around you like in the end scene from Raiders of the Lost Ark. Suddenly, without warning, the spirits turn on you and tear you apart with freeze spells.15. Much improved third-person view. It is now excellent.16. Combat now no longer resembles chopstick fighting and has been significantly tweaked.17. The in-game menu now boasts a ""help"" section akin to Civilization's civilopedia which explains basic game concepts for noobs.18. Backpeddling can no longer be exploited -as successfully- on combat.19. Dynamic weather effects contribute to immersion.20. Dragon shouts are a blast (pun intended).21. Archery has been revamped and is miles better now. The archery perk system adds a ton of fun. I love how you can now easily recycle arrows which have been fired against objects (i.e. wooden beams) or simply lying on the ground.22. Dwarven long lost city ruins are back with strength! Oblivion had completely neglected them and were sorely missed from Morrowind. The whole map is littered with them ranging from large cities to towers and dungeons (with automatons defending them).Cons1. Awful scripted beginning, as per usual in Bethesda games. The first 20 minutes are a complete letdown. Bethesda is no good at scripted events (Oblivion's was just as bad in the initial jail-dungeon section with the emperor). In the opening scene two imperial guards glide their feet on moving, like a ghost; they do not walk. This is a horrible immersion-breaking visual bug. I saw this twice. There is no opening memorable moment like when in Oblivion you crawl out of the dungeon and see for the first time the beautiful lush world of Cyrodill with its bewithcing music score.2. The first thing that annoyed me to no end was the uber bothersome hotkey system which only allows you to hot key two items only (left and right trigger) on the Xbox 360. Being used to Oblivion's eight hotkeys this felt like a very poor design decision and I just cannot understand it. After playing for over 88 hours my first impression remains the same and has not improved. The hotkey system should be addressed ASAP, if possible, to have 8 hotkeys with your D-pad. It is stupid and game-breaking to pause the game everytime and scroll down your favourite list to get to a torch, a spell or your favourite weapon. It breaks immersion and its is very irritating.3. The music score is nowhere near as good as Oblivion's. It is more mature and epic-like but lacks Oblivion's unique warmth. Yes I know it's the same score composer, Jeremy Soule.4. Chests now are NOT arranged by item-type. This is a complete nightmare and a very poor design decision. In Oblivion you stored thousands of items in chests or drawers and this was automatically arranged by classes: weapons, armour, potions, apparel etc. It was very easy to scroll down and find an object. No longer the case. Now in Skyrim everything is in one list!!! Even if you select an item as favourite to highlight it is not enough as you collect and store thousands of objects ranging from ingredients to weapons. This must be addressed ASAP!! It is a nightmare to scroll down a list of thousands of items. I use Hamvir's Rest chest to store all my items as I can easily fast travel to it and it's in the open air.5. Some problems with close-up texture resolutions. i.e. that stone tower (Riverwood Folly?) next to Bleak Falls Barrow Falls. The snow on the floor wooden beams looks very poor and uniform. To be fair, the snow texture when you are up at the Pale is better. But compared to Dragon Age Origins or Uncharted 2 it looks amateurish.6. Some stuttering framerate issues which slow down action are apparent as from 65 hours of play onwards.7. When you re-enter a zone after having killed a dragon its bones seem to fall from the sky and act like wobbling jelly.8. Some dragons just drop dead from the sky for no apparent reason.9. My one-handed skill went red and dropped to 20 when it was at 69. This is a bug as I have no diseases (I'm a werewolf and therefore immune to diseases). Moreover I sought blessings from altars and this doesn't help either. My hope is that on levelling up (to level 40) it will be self-resolved.10. Ysgramor's battle axe (Wuuthrad) can no longer be equipped once Glory of the Dead questline is over. I tried picking it up from the statue and the game wouldn't let me. Edit: you have to click on Ysgramor's statue, not on the axe itself.11. A few bugs such as arrows and other objects (such as wisp mother stones) hovering in mid-air. Hopefully all these minor bugs will be ironed out in the next weeks or months.12. Stupid companion chooses to equip his hunters bow instead of the legendary ebony 92 damage bow I smithed for him. Frequently companions choose to wear lower quality gear and weapons despite having better options available. Even if the top end gear weighs less and is more valuable they still choose lower end spec for no apparent reason.13. My companion war dog, Vigilance, died on me repeatedly. I reloaded the first three times to save him but the fourth time I chose to let him die. What's the point of having a companion that literally dies on you every two fights? Maybe Bethesda should equip dogs with an armour. Wait, scratch that. Next thing we know Todd will be selling us a ""dog armour"" DLC at USD 5 a piece on January 2012. Cough -horse armour- cough d&eacute;j&agrave; vu.14. The healing animation now takes precious seconds as the spell needs to charge which in the midst of a combat is a luxury you simply cannot afford.15. Curing lycantrophy quest is currently bugged. This is extremely annoying as the Companions quest forces you to become one and it cannot be removed (until its patched).ConclusionYou must buy and play this game even if you are not into RPGs and do not consider yourself a geek. No doubt it well-deserves 2011's Game of The Year award. The replayability and depth are simply astounding . You can literally plough hundreds of hours into the core game, not to mention the upcoming DLC expansions in January next year. To put it simply, Skyrim is a masterpiece.Todd & team, my thanks for such a wonderful game.Drakan"
i have always loved elder scrolls and this buy far passes those with every thing that is in it ...
my son asked for this game so i got it for him. he was estatic when he opened it. it has the booklet and the disc.
"As an original Oblivion lover, I couldn't wait to get my hands on this game and I was not let down.Immediately noticeable to me where the graphics.  Stunning is the word that comes to mind and that is just the beginning.  If you are a old school Oblivion player, then most of the controls will come second nature to you.  I've been playing for about 3 hours now and just leveled up....yes I've been taking my time and exploring as much as possible.  Even the level up experience is wonderful and graphically beautiful.  You look out into constellations and choose your ""perk"" (love that they call it that!)  and that then opens up more stars for your abilities to grow.It took awhile to create the character in the beginning as I really wanted to see them all.  There was definite lag between what my cursor told me I was seeing and what was actually being displayed on the screen.  Nonetheless, the wait was worth while.I can venture to say that there will be many, many, sleepless nights ahead in my future.thank you Bethesda!"
To say that this game stand alone is equivalent to hundreds of full retail releases is Still an understatement. Bethesda has managed to create a single player game that has all the elements and advantages of an MMO while retaining all the pros of a single player package.Completely Unrivaled.
"I got this for him for Christmas. Its a very interesting game, but has lots of glitches so he has to restart missions."
"I've got a ridiculous amount of hours in this game and I've played Oblivion, Fallout, Fallout NV, and Morrowind.They've dumbed the game down.Yes, they didn't streamline it.  They've dumbed it down.  End of story.Anyone who says that there was no clear explanation as to skill points and what they affected WASN'T READING THE SCREEN when they spent them.  ALSO:  When you leveled in a particular skill (like lockpicking) didn't you notice that spending a skill point in intelligence would've given you a HUGE boost?  Of course not, because you weren't reading the screen and undoubtedly never cracked open your user manual.It's just like the customer in drive through that drives past the preview board to the speaker so they can stare at THAT menu board.  They weren't paying any degree of attention.  (the preview board is for figuring out what you want so that you don't have to spend minutes figuring out what you want and running up the timer)ALSO:  anyone who said mysticism was a pointless class must have abstained from enchanted weapons and armor.  To completely dissolve the class of mysticism and reclassify all spells under ""alteration"" is proof that such a claim was straight bull.  Also, screw you for taking away the unlocking spell AND the ability to spellcraft.ALSO:  Are you really blind to the fact that the ""perk"" system was just what they gave you when you progressed through the novice, apprentice, journeyman, and master level system?ALSO:  Instead of making alchemy tables you could've just made the tools weightless, like you did with the arrows.  Now I can't mix potions on the run anymore.Any reason why they took away the acrobat skill?  I loved being able to progress to the point of jumping rivers and being able to drop from certain heights without dying."
"How I got this game is beyond me but I gotta tell ya, ""Skyrim"" is nothing short of the perfect storm of genius, creativity, story-telling, and quality graphics that no other game has, even as 2013 draws to a close.Taking place in a diverse set of mountains, forests, snow, ice, rain, you name it, ""Skyrim"" is the ultimate open-world game for all time. Costumizing your character, dragons of various kinds, enemy soldiers, possessed skeleton infantry, and various monsters, Skyrim is a game to devote weeks to playing.I've been playing this for over a year now and still find myself enjoying every moment of it. You can discover hundres of locations, all of which possess unique characteristics, creatures, and cultures. There's also building up skills of various abilities ranging from destruction, to lock-picking, to stealth.Of all the great reviews I've seen, they are all justified in praising ""Skyrim"". As the Xbox 360 era prepares to wind down in preparation for Xbox One, ""Skyrim"" will be among the last of the 360 games to leave my household.So if you're upset that your Xbox Live subscription expired and you don't have the money yet to renew it, just pop in ""Skyrim"" and play away. It's that great. :D"
"Well folks, it's finally here: 11.11.11Skyrim, simply put, is awesome! One of my favorite functions of the game is that the developers do not put you and your character into a box, which is really cool. In most RPGs you're forced to pick a class, like say a warrior, a mage, or a rogue. In Skyrim you can fit your character to your exact play style. If you want to wield a 'sword and board' and still have the ability to perform magic, you can. This is thanks to the talent tree that lets you pick whatever paths you want to go down on the fly. You can perform jobs, such as mining, and craft your own weapons.This makes the gameplay rather unique and unpredictable and it allows you to approach things in the game differently than you would in other RPGs.I'm already an RPG fan, but Bethesda did a good job of appealing to both we RPG fans as well as the general gamer. Skyrim is gigantic, and I'm not overstating this. I've not spent a lot of my time in the game so far just exploring. The immerse world will suck you in and really give you the feeling that you are part of this fictional world.The amount of stuff you can do and interact with is virtually unlimited. In fact, the developers put a feature in the game that outside of the main story line, makes the game never ending. It's a really neat feature and it will probably having me playing it as much as Oblivion, which I have been going back to time and again for the last 5 years.Skyrim has some release day bugs, but nothing that hampers game play that I've encountered. It seems as though they've learned some lessons from Fallout.It seems as though Bethesda has saved the best for last. I have had about 6 hours of game time with Skyrim so far and the game is living up to all of the hype and anticipation. Next to Batman: Arkham City, this is a solid contender for Game of the Year.This game is worthy of you collection, and even if you're not an RPG fan, I recommend this one. You'd be remiss to pass this one by."
"I encourage all gamers who like immersive experiences to pick this up and give it a try. There is much to do in Skyrim! It's not a hard core dungeon crawl like Dark Souls, but lighter fare."
Bought this for my son. Ordered the used version since it was much less expensive. The game appears to have been used very little if at all. All papers were still in the box. My son loves it.
This is a great game. It is really cool to take your weak guy and build him up into a killing machine. There are so many different things to investigate and do in this game I think I may be playing it for months. There are also some addons you can buy that make the game even longer. Lots of fun.
Lol. jk about the title. =P Seriously this is a great game for me and most of the time i love just wandering around. I beat it a few times and love coming back just to explore more. The thing that really annoys me about the game though is that pupil effect. I have working pupils! I don't need emulated ones to! They become a bit uncomfortable! It looks like a camera auto adjust feature. I didn't even know what it was supposed to be until i looked it up! I really wish it could be turned off. Other then that i'm loving this game!
"I've had skyrim for a while now, but I wanted to wait until I pretty much had experienced everything I could before writing a review for it.  I didn't want to fully endorse it only to find something that ruined the game for me.  Of course, nothing happened like that.I know you've heard this from a bunch of different ""fanboys"" a bunch of different times but this game is awesome!  I mean, this is a true RPG right here.  It's huge!  The world is massive and is just chuck full of things to explore.  Gone are the times in the bast games when you would wander for miles and not encounter much at all.  Now you are exploring caves, ruins, barracks, towns, cities almost constantly.  That doesn't mean that you won't be able to just explore and take in the scenery, however.  There are tons of places to climb up and see for miles and I would recommend it because this game is very good looking.  The world is one of the most finely crafted I have seen in a video game.There are many things you can do as well.  There is a pretty lengthy main quest that I found to be very good but I would constantly get sidetracked by my curiosity of my surroundings and people coming up to me to give me a side-quest.  There are a handful of guilds to join and play through as well that have had a lot of attention paid to them.  Add to this the ability to smith your own armor, create your own potions, etc. and you have a bunch to do in this game.There are also a ton of improvements to the combat from past games and conversing with the NPCs is much more fluid and interesting this time around.It's not perfect.  Im sure you've hear about quite a few bugs and glitches in the game.  Those are true.  The thing is,though, not all of them happen in every single copy of the game.  Very rarely are they game-breaking either.  They are usually just amusing little things like flying mammoths that float gently to the ground after a while and stuff like that.  Things I easily overlooked in that grand scope of the game.If you have decided not to play the game only because of something bad you've heard about it then you will be missing one of the best games to date.  If anything you should also read about why people like it and then play it while giving it a chance.  You'll probably find yourself wrapped up in it like I did."
"In spite of the glitches I have encountered in this game, I still find it very fun to play and the hours seem to fly by when I get too immersed in this game world. You don't find many games that are as rewarding to play as this one so I definitely give it a five star rating."
One of my favorites! There just so much to do in this game! And I've gotta say after a long day there's nothing like werewolfing out and eating some hearts. Crazy fun game!
It's just an excellent game!  It's a long game which I like to play & would buy this again because it's a great game.
"Very good game, best Elder Scrolls yet.  I played Oblivion and thought Skyrim was better, although I did not play all the expansions and extra content, still great."
"I haven't reviewed this till now, I have had it since it came out.I have at least 200+(maybe 300 something?) hours on one character.  I love everything about this game...except the glitches that may happen every so often.  Find the wiki, for glitch and extra quest info.  Armor, weapon, enchantment, and potion crafting all feel rewarding.  I love walking for hours and just finding things.  This game is vast and not everything is on the beaten path.  Stealthing in heavy armor with muffled boots, knife, and bow is great.  I don't think you need the DLC to enjoy this but the DLC is good as well.Long live single player Elder Scrolls games!"
Granted I am only several hours into the game I am digging the new changes. The graphics in this game are phenomenal and the gameplay and voice acting is better then ever. A Must have for any fan of Open Ended RPG's. I would rate this game on a scale of 100 99 out of 100. Goodbye world see you in a year lol.
I am basing this on what my son tells me about it.  I personally dont play xbox 360 games but he owns the console and loves this game he says its exciting and fun to play.
These type of games are seldom likeable but this one is the coolest one i have ever played it has really good scenarios its very realistic it has millions of things to do.  the skills menu is huge you dont know what to do with so many options and its hard to playi would recommend that first take i look at the previews and see if you like but i believe you will like it
"Wonderful game, great graphics. Get it, play it, your love it. Highly recommend this game . One of those games you will play again and again"
"A very good game for a fair price. You will get lots of hours from this game, I must of got at least 100 hours"
"Seriously, how much time do you have? Because this game will destroy your social life. No matter when you buy it. I bought it 2 months ago and enjoy it as much as anyone else who bought it for 60$ when it first came out. I'd recomend this game if you have a lot of time to kill between now and the next game release that you are looking forward to (if any). This is an immense world with plenty, plenty, plenty to do. Only reason it's not 5 stars is because it gets glitchy with the questing at times."
"This is an excellent open world game that has some thing for every one. From exploring the wide open spaces, to delving into forgotten ruins this is and adventure. With plenty of crafting to do and wide variety of skills and professions this game will keep you busy for a long time."
Great game for those who enjoy quests.  So many different  quests and levels.  Nobody gets bored with this game.Fast moving and challenging.
"I can not stop playing, I am lost to the sidequest..this world lives and breathes even as I type this review. The graphics are of course better on PC and the mod community is already hard at work to create new experiences.However you can not help but be sucked into this world, the level of detail will have you awestruck. From the cold tundra, to the lush forested areas, you will find yourself with a case of a.d.d. And just when you think you have caught your breath, helping out a troubled lady or playing tag with the children..dragons will mess up your day. I cant even think of anything else to say but BUY THIS GAME. RPG lovers, action lovers..Anyone with the slightest sense for adventure should get this game. It is an unforgetable experience.If you are coming from previous Elder scrolls games you will appreciate how natural leveling up now feels. You can choose what you want to level up, but the more areas you focus on,the quicker you will gain overal experience towards your actual level. It just feels natural. Each level up allows you to put points into various trees that grant you new abilities. Works out nicely!"
"You can sit on this game all day and not get bored. Fus Ro Da! and you've found your ticket to a great time in this game. There are great weapons, creative enemies and challenging quests. If you haven't bought this game already you should. Don't get rid of that 360 just yet."
"This is undoubtedly, the best game I have ever played in my life. Everything about this game is absolutely AMAZING."
"Just after Christmas I purchased a new XBox 360 console to replace a previous one and included in the bundle with my new console was Skyrim and another game. I hadn't had any inclination to play Skyrim before, but I thought, why not play it since I got it for free? If you're a fan of the Fallout series, you'll enjoy Skryim. Most of the mechanics are the same and it's definitely a game that's well worth the money as you'll most likely end up spending hundreds of hours exploring the land, levelling up your skills and completing tons of quests among other things. Be warned: Playing Skyrim can be very addictive."
"This game is highly addictive just like the previous version, Oblivion. Be prepared to spend 100 hours or more on this game.  I think Skyrim is for both young and old, hard core and casual gamers. There are something for everyone. If you enjoy reading, Elder Scroll has a deep story line, with hundred of books you can read through.  For the history buffs,  Bethesda has done extensive research, much of the game setting is in Scandinavia during the medieval time. You can really see their attention to detail in the languages and artworks. If you love nature, there are many beautiful places you can visit, rivers, tundras, forests and mountains. Or if you enjoy art and architecture, you can head out to many towns, villages and ruins, go into homes, look at their furniture and decorations.  Most of the dialogues are great and so is the music.The only complain I have is that most of the quests are more of less the same.  You go into a cave, fight of enemies of either humans, creatures or undead. I was hoping they had more non-fighting quests.Overall, I think most people should be able to find something they enjoy from Skyrim.  Playing this game is like going off for two weeks adventure vacation in some far away places, and all for $60."
wish sometimes that I never bought this game for me and my bf because its so damn addicting that we can't quit playing... but hey... a couple who plays together stays together.
"Well I dont think i need to write a long review seeing there are enough of those on here. This game is great! Time really does go by fast while playing, hours went by in a blink of an eye and I haven't even touched the main story yet. Instead i heard of a city where i could train my magic, Winterhold which is on the otherside of the map, so i traveled there on foot. The world is HUGE! It took me a long time to reach Winterhold, I had to swim, climb mountains, walk through blizzards ands swamps, encounter assassins and other foes, but when i finally reached Winterhold it felt so rewarding. To think there are dozens of more places to travel and even more things to do there is just overwhelming. Like i said, this is a great game, i feel like i ripped off Bethesda by buying it! Seriously, get it!"
"There's not really much to say about Skyrim that most other reviewers haven't already echoed.  The game is simply beautiful, exploring and coming across caves and rivers and a thousand other things just has a certain magic to it.  The combat, while still not perfect, has gotten a large improvement from Oblivion.  I enjoyed most of the quests, and the faction quests steal the show yet again.  The replay value you get in this one is immense, and if you use a ""dollars to hours"" ratio, you can get a lot of entertainment for just a few pennies per hour (my game lasted about 150 hours).  This is a game I found myself clawing for more time to play.  Sitting for thirty minutes or an hour often accomplishes you nothing, and marathon sessions are the way to go if you really want to be immersed.  A small disappointment was the quality of the loot (sort of a moot point considering the strengths of the game).  In Oblivion you could find items that gave your permanent night vision or let you walk on water when worn.  I hoped to find similar items here (they may exist but I've never found them) but more often than not you only get some gold and weak  items from caves/dungeons, especially considering the fact you can craft your own powerful weapons and armor from a few raw materials.  I did have 10-15 complete freezes during the course of the game, and they were annoying, but I tried to save often which lessened the headache.Overall an amazing achievement and must-buy."
"Let's get to the flaws right off the bat. Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim, like in Morrowind and Oblivion, will make it very hard to keep up on school work if you're a student . . . you'll be at risk of failing your classes everytime you pick up the controller. And your relationships, your marriage, your friendships . . . kiss them all goodbye, or somehow find a way to maintain them and . . . well, the fat, greedy elephant in the room that wants you to join it in the sacrifice of hours and days--and months: Skyrim. Okay, but if you have no school, no job, no friends, no spouse, well then this game really has no flaws for you. You've got nothing to lose. Okay, okay, okay--you got me--I'm being sarcastic as heck. It's just an unoffical inside joke for those of us that understand the Elder Scrolls.The story is simple. You're about to get executed in a world where there's a civil war between Nords and Imperials, and Dragons--that had been extinct for hundreds and hundreds of years--saves you in the nick of time . . . by setting the whole town in flames. You make your escape. And when you do escape, the world is yours.Skyrim doesn't pretend to be what it isn't. Unlike Fable, it doesn't boast about being a game where choices change the coarse of events for everything to come and how characters think of you . . . no, Bethesda (developer) never boasted anything like that. But, to my surprise, the game is exactly that. Characters will regard you by what you've done, how you look, etc.. Bethesda has taken elements from Morrowind, Oblivion and Fallout 3--ultimately perfecting their formula, they threw in some Lord of the Rings, some Bioshock combat mechanics (which are great), some World of Warcraft misc. mission stuff (but on a bigger scale, and less dorky--in other words Skyrim is WOW for cool kids and dorky kids alike), and gameplay elements where choice comes into play, like in Fable or Mass Effect 2 (except Skyrim surpasses those games by a thousand).To say Skyrim is the greatest game of all time is an understatement. It is the single greatest achievement in mainstream-art, be that in film, music, videogames, etc. I even would compare Skyrim to the greatness of Tolkien's Lord of the Rings--and likely better. It really is that good. If you look at the one or two stars on Amazon, you'll see that they complain that the world is too big. BUT THAT IS WHY SKYRIM IS SO GOOD. It isn't easy; it's hard (not Dark Souls hard, but close)--it's not for the faint hearted; it's not for someone who works full time and is trying to keep a healthy marriage; it's not for someone who has ADHD (no offense). The game is thought provoking, incredible, provokative, epic, beautiful.You don't even have to do the main missions all the time to be honest, and that's the whole point of the game. You can just wander, and wander, and wander some more, until you find something worth applying effort in completing. There's literally hundreds upon hundreds of missions in the game.Simply put, Skyrim is the greatest game of all time. Shame on those for giving it one stars because their ""games don't save"" (yeah right!) or that ""it's too big"" (which I wouldn't mind if it was bigger). And for some reason Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 fans are hating on Skyrim . . . or maybe it's worst . . . maybe they think if they just ignore Skyrim, then they'll be happy in their COD world. And then there are those people who just ""don't understand"" the hype, and they're scared of the game because they're rebels and don't like popular things at the time of popularity. For instance, I hated Harry Potter until about last year (which is when I actually sat down and read the books); so, what I'm saying is that: you can't hate something until you try it. But Skyrim is calling you to be played, my friends. However, you have to be mature. You have to be good at managing your time, because once you step in, your social life won't be the same."
Bought this for the girlfriend and I have started playing it too. Can't seem to get enough of it. I guess I should let her play it more.
"I have played hundreds of hours of Morrowind and Oblivion and I am the biggest fan of the series I know, so waiting for Skyrim to come out was a big deal.  I played through the main quest really fast the first time because I was short on time, and I actually rated this game 3/5 here.  Well I had to edit this review after playing through again, and doing most of the side quests as well as the Dawnguard and Dragonborn expansions.  This is the best single player game I have ever played, enough said.  Just make sure you have at least 100 hours to spare.  :)"
Fun Game!
"I hate it when people say something is &#34;epic&#34; and what they're really saying is &#34;that was really rad.&#34;  Skyrim however truly is an epic game- with the expansions I've put in like 250 hours playing it and I'm still discovering stuff.The gameplay sticks relatively close to Oblivion and the Fallout games, which is good.  Of course it has been tweaked ever so slightly so as to improve on those games.  I think the best update to the interface is you can favorite weapons and whatnot to quickly access them without going through the whole menu.  The only problem with that is you end up having a few favorite items and it gets clogged pretty quickly to a really long list if you're not careful.The graphics are pretty good, probably some of the best on 360.  I know you can mod the crap out of it on the PC, but the 360 version is just fine.  The sound is pretty good, as it should be when one of the biggest story elements is shouting.  Yes, shouting is a weapon of sorts, but it does make sense as you play the game.The storylines are pretty good, and there's a bit of that subdued Bethesda humor sprinkled about.  Without spoiling anything, there's a quest that involves the author of &#34;The Lusty Argonian Maid.&#34;  Basically it's a Harlequin romance novel, and you can read it if you find it in the game, which you will as it seems everyone has a copy!  Perverts, the whole lot of them!If you buy this game, prepare your loved ones beforehand that they will not see you for a couple of weeks or so.  That's probably the best advice I can give for this game as you will become engrossed in all of it's epic glory."
"{updated, 200+ hours in, level 41}I have started 2 other characters, but my main guy is level 41 now. This game is simply amazing. I purchased Dawnguard and it's easily worth the 14.99 price tag. Bethesda did such a great job with the expansion because everything is so well thought out and extremely vibrant. The main quest for Dawnguard is LONG. It was estimated about 10-20 hours long; I am taking thing a little slow and I am around on my 16th hour. I might be around 75% done, so 25 hours seems like it will be around that for me. It's not like Shivering Isle for Oblivion where there is a vast landscape for you to roll around it. Dawnguard is a castle in Skyrim itself on your map. Bethesda also added tons of new caves and forts so you can accompany the main quest. This is a no spoiler review so I will just leave it at; you can either follow the main quest and be a Vampire Hunter. Or you can accept the agreement of the vampire Demon Lord and become a Demon Lord. That's not a spoiler - it was in countless interviews with Todd Howard and even in commercials. But there are other surprises along the way if you stay a Vampire hunter.As for the main game; everything is fixed. All the bugs, crashes, quest drops, etc. The game is perfect. I have most of all the locations discovered on my map and it looks awesome. Like I said, I am at level 41 with an easy 150 hours on my main character - not to mention 200+ hours in total gameplay. As for my main character, I still have plenty to do; mages quest, multiple side quest, a lot of misc quest to finish up, and to clear all of the locations I have discovered.With BF/Holidays coming, get this game, it will consume your life and there will be plenty of sales on it.{updated, 75 hours in, level 32}Game never gets old, however, I would not download the latest 1.2 patch Bethesda put out. Apparently it messed up a few things and I would just not download it and play offline. I am sure Bethesda is working on the problem.{updated, 50 hours in, level 28}This game continues to bring a fresh breath of air each and every time I play it. I have not done any guilds, have done only 1 part of the main mission (went to high harothgar to make unrelenting force more powerful), and haven't done a lot of the 'big' quest. I have concentrated on cave/ruins/fort looting with my sneak/bow master with some 'misc' quest mixed in. I have over 120 locations discovered and around 50 cleared. This game has exceeded my expectations in almost every way imaginable. For me, and in my opinion I will add, is the game of the generation and GOTY 2011.{updated, 16 hours in, level 13}This game has exceeded my expectations and I didn't even know that could happen because I set such a high bar for it. Everything in this game is smooth, no more glitches, bugs, freezes, etc. It runs so similar to fallout 3 with graphics and NPC except they are much smoother and responsive. The character animations have improved greatly, no more weird, awkward NPC talk. Skyrim is basically Fallout 3 graphics and animations but much smoother and improved, and everything great about Oblivion but much more polished out. It seems as if the Fallout 3 crowd loves it, but hated Oblivion. The magic is very smooth and amazing, however, you will need to increase your magic significantly if you want to be a pure mage... I am a hybrid because some monsters are quick and you cannot hit them with any spells. Marksman also serves a great purpose in this game. That is all, enjoy!-----------------------------------------------------All I can say is wow, I am not going to go into depth too much because this game is full of spoilers...Animations are incredible, character detail is incredible, story is incredible, NPC is absolutely better than Oblivion, lock picking is similar to Fallout 3, graphics are top notch, character leveling up is simplified and very easy to understand, and there are plenty of things to do.Story {Quests}: 9.5/10Graphics {ran in DX9, had to because of all the detail and mere size of this game}: 9/10Fun: 10/10Sounds: 10/10Longevity: 10/10Interaction: 10/10Overall: 9.6Like I said, that's about all I am going to go into it.... This is easy game of the year, hope everyone enjoys!"

"I'm an avid gamer, have been since the space invaders and asteroids when I was a kid.  I do a lot of gaming, and have three different types of consoles (three xbox 360's, a PS3, and a Wii).  It's a great way for me to relax from work.  So I've done a lot of games, and written many reviews on them.  But most end up falling short somehow, no matter how enjoyable they are.  It may just be the control layout, buttons used, or SOMETHING.  Something that really detracts from all the other strengths.  It's incredibly rare to get one that just is absolutely perfect on every single level, but once again, these folks seem to have done it.Oblivion was one of my all time favorite games on the Xbox.  I played it to death, got all the DLC, and kept playing long after I ""won"" the story lines.  Just such an immersive environment, so enjoyable to sink myself into.  So I had high hopes for this title, and they certainly delivered.Graphics are fantastic.  Granted, I think the new Call of Duty Modern Warfare 3 had nicer overall graphics, so there ARE games out there that do better, but in this instance, in no way a detraction, and I may not have even noticed it much except I had played COD 3 nights straight after it came out to win it before this title was released, so I had just spent many hours in COD immediately preceding playing this game.  But while they may not be as good as COD, they exceeded the graphics from Oblivion and are just smooth and breathtaking.  The vistas from on high, the mist, the smoke from things, it's just a visual smorgasbord.But where they excel, always, is gameplay.  Smooth combat, and I think the best control layout and options since Halo 1...  There's never a time that I complain about the controls because the layout is so good that it just feels natural.This is also the first time I've played a game on its release day and had so many hours into it without any lockups or bugs.  It wasn't until about 40 hours of actual gameplay that I finally found one - an autosave point after I won a big boss battle, and going back to it was flawed because I'd fall through the floor into a previous level that was not locked out because of how the door closed and sealed once you entered the final boss room.  So I was stuck and couldn't go anywhere to complete things.  I just reverted to the save I had before the boss battle and won the fight again, this time saving it manually at a point that my character wasn't just completing a fighting move.  No issues since then.The customization of the character in the beginning is again about the best one I've come across, and the most detailed.  Let me get a character looking exactly how I wanted it.The storyline is pretty sweeping as well, and easy to get caught up in.  And the amount of area to wander is just mind boggling.  I haven't even hit the ""you cannot go here"" message yet, and I've gone incredible distances in all directions.The challenge even at the middle difficulty setting is pretty astonishing as well, some of the big bosses just annihilate you within two or three seconds of hitting you.  But usually there's a way to stay alive (using trees or rock formations and such to keep between you and the big boss while you snipe at them around the edges) and the only time there wasn't, I had to actually wimp out and drop it down a difficulty level to get past it.  Which is another nice thing they have, is how you can adjust the difficulty level in the middle of something without having to restart.  Then when you're past whatever you couldn't get past, hop it up again.  I'll come back to this fight later (I keep all my major save points) and see if I can eventually do it without dropping it down.The choice of weapons is nice, and the ways to modify them and customize your own really adds that immersive touch to the game.Interactions with NPC's isn't as bad as most other games of the genre, and the fact that you can hit the button to jump them to the next line of conversation is a lifesaver for people who don't want to listen the sometimes longwinded speeches given in response to a question.The new way of choosing your perks is pretty neat, a great visualization of constellations for each of your skills.  It gives a great instant visual overview of where you're strong, where you're weak.It took me just a couple nights of playing COD after hours to win the game, but I've been playing this one for nearing or passing 40 hours now and I'm still nowhere near done.  I'm not rushing through it, since there's so much to do on the sides, but that's one of the things that their games really excelled at - playability.  It's not just a linear ""go here do this"" every single step of the way.All in all, one of the most solid games I've gotten in years.  This one will definitely be one of the top contenders for Game of the Year, no question.  And it would certainly get MY vote.Edit 11/28/11:  Took one star off - game is still awesome, but I'm just very frustrated and tired of the lockups that finally happened.  I was very happy that it appeared, for the first 30 or 40 hours of gameplay, to finally be one of their first games that didn't lock up on me, but after I hit about 40 or so hours, it locks up regularly, forcing me to hard power off the Xbox and back on again to get it working.  Save your game often, you never know when you're going to get hosed with a lockup...  From what I see in the forums, there are a LOT of people with this issue so hopefully there's an update at some point to address it."
"This game is enormous!  I bought the first Elder Scrolls for my original old Xbox perhaps 8 years ago.  Everything is better, of course,  in this new one for my xbox 360.  If you have a serious case of acrophobia, some of the scenes might be a little scary.  You need to explore EVERy possibility.... go in the water, take a chance,  Talk to EVERYONE.  Go into every building.  Try not to miss anything!  Very worthy game!"
"This is the fifth entry in the Elder Scrolls series. There are a few changes. First, there is no class system. Raising any skill will increase your level. The fighter's guild has been reworked in the companions. There are actual dragons to fight here. The quests are challenging, but beatable. Overall, a satisfying game."
"I've been an Elder Scrolls fan since the days of Morrowind. Morrowind was a revolutionary game, dropping you into a completely open ended (first OR third person) sandbox, where you are free to steal anything you lay eyes on, and kill whoever you see! You could play this game for months without doing a single main story mission and still never remotely lose interest. THAT is a game worth buying!Then Oblivion came out. Yeah they got rid of some stuff from Morrowind, but they updated SO much more! And graphically.... just an amazing game with an amazing story.THEN, Skyrim came out. I lost 2 months of my life starting in that fateful November. This game is EPICALLY AWESOME. It keeps with the Elder Scrolls trends and lore, and adds in Dragons!! I still can't describe that first dragon encounter you get to in the main story. The fear. The adrenaline. The sheer awesomeness when you slay the beast and absorb its soul. Mere words do not do it justice. And the DLC they've released as all been awesome.HONESTLY, I might recommend holding out until a GOTY edition comes out with all the DLC included. But even if you don't wait on that, you will NOT be disappointed with this title. Easily one of the best RPGs ever made. Don't miss it!!"
"Amazing graphic and design.The one star deducted is for Amazon. The stupid dispatch ship the games and the baby formula together!!! Can you imagine how they will put such kind of heavy stuff on top of a game? I am so lucky just the plastic wrap get broken and the cover get shrinked. If the game got damaged, I will definately give them a negative and return."
"I haven't played Oblivion (yet) and only a little of Morrowind when I was too young to appreciate the vast worlds of the Elder Scrolls series. So, going into this installment, I had no idea what to expect besides a grand adventure.You don't have to have played the previous games to understand things in this one. You can be brought up to speed by reading the well-written tomes found in-game. I'm now aware of the Oblivion Crisis, the Daedric Princes and many other stories of Oblivion.At the time of writing this I'm a level 47 Nord female. I own almost every purchasable property in Skyrim (I've installed Hearthfire) and my family and I reside in Lakeview Manor. I love the aspect of having a family in the game. It gives it a little more depth than just having a house to store your junk in, and the house doesn't feel as empty. I have one adopted child, Runa, and my character is married to Farkas from The Companions. Uthgerd the Unbroken is my steward.Onto the actual review. Since I don't want to drag on about every little detail, I'll simply list pros and cons, then my final thoughts for the game.PROS:+The sheer size of the world doesn't feel overwhelming or daunting to a new player of the series, doesn't force you to rush through anything+Wonderful art direction, music and atmosphere+Quest lines are deep and gripping, you come to feel for the characters involved+Awesome combat system+Large number of weapon and armor types and classes for every kind of player+Leveling up and skill trees/perks really make the RPG experience enjoyable and not a grind+Volumes of followers make questing more exciting and involved+Hundreds of books, diaries and journals exist that provide unique insight to quests and the overall mythos of Tamriel+Detailed map over-world with markers and a good way-point/fast travel system makes travel across Skyrim a breeze+Flora and fauna of the world are intriguing and well-designed+Smithing, enchanting, naming and improving weapons and armor create a sense of customization not found in other RPGs+Makes great use of the 360 controller and all the buttons+First and third-person views have their own unique advantages and are both playable+Each dungeon has its own recognizable design, allowing for development of strategies for completing each one+Loads of enemy types and variations, with their own weaknesses and abilities makes combat exciting+Changeable difficulty, even during combat, makes the game user-friendly and encourages trying again with a different strategy rather than giving up to go back and grinding more during difficult battles+Random events and battles make the game feel un-scripted and real+The huge amount of unique loot there is to be had in the game is awesome for people who like unique weapons and armor+Even dungeons and ""fetch-quests"" are fun in this game, they aren't boring whatsoever, and can sometimes be surprising in the endCONS:+After completing the ""Civil War"" quest line, most people still talk like the war is still going on, no matter who won. I mainly completed that quest so the people would talk about something else, but they did not+Loading times are pretty long, especially coming in and out of buildings+Having to run back and forth to a house to store loot, when the weight system could be patched a little to carry more+Inventory system should have auto-categorize options, especially when putting items in containers (such as labeling which books are skill books)+Containers in built houses (from Hearthfire) should be shared in every house so one doesn't have to waste time running to each house for different things, or having to move everything from one place to another after building a new house+Shopkeepers don't usually have enough gold to buy your goods, and you have to wait for them to get more, which can be tiresome+There are many, many glitches I've encountered, and it makes the game feel very unfinished+Not enough voice actors and phrases to go around the world, the same handful keep showing up and it gets repetitive quickly+Dialog choices given to the player make ""The Dragonborn"" sound foolish or downright stupid, and are often told so by the NPCs+Dragons seem to show up a little too much randomly in-game. They should be a more rare sight rather than one or two showing up every 20 minutes+Draugr enemies shouldn't be able to shout you to death instantly (I've encountered this several times)+Inns and some other buildings are all the exact same model internally, which looks boring+All quest-givers should be marked as ""essential"" and therefore unable to be killed by dragon attacks or other mishaps until their quest is completed, I almost couldn't buy Lakeview manor because many quest givers were killed during a dragon attack and wouldn't have been able to ""assist the people of Falkreath"" to become Thane+Being ""boxed in"" by a follower can become quite annoying, or even deadly if they accidentally push you off a cliff or into enemy fireMy final thoughts on The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim:It would have been almost perfect if they had taken an extra couple of months, gotten more voice actors, written more dialog, and fixed a few more bugs.However, despite its flaws, this is an absolutely amazing game. One of the best there is, and now one of my personal favorites for sure. Any RPG fan, even those who might not be into dungeons and the like, will love this game and should support it by purchasing it. This should be a part of everyone's collection. Being the Dragonborn has been one of the most enjoyable adventures I've had in a long, long time. From the moment I escaped the executioner's block I knew this would be an exciting, action-packed game."
"I'm a huge fan of these games.  I loved Oblivion.  I couldn't wait to play this.  I don't pay $60 for a game on principle, so I waited for some time and got this for under twenty bucks, used.  It's so awesome.  My 360 died and I recently picked up a new one - it's designed like the XBox One and runs very quiet, but I've been having issues with this game on there - video glitches and wait glitches.  Now, I didn't apply the update - because as we all know, doing that wipes out a lot of the cool cheats / workarounds!  I hate worrying about gold!  I just WANT it!  Anyhow - I digress.  This game is so excellent, it's hard to imagine it being better.  The graphics are astounding, the load times are nothing - especially when compared to Oblivion (maybe it's my new 360?) and it's just SO much fun!  I'm having so much fun doing the side quests that I don't even care about the main one.  Exploring, looting, etc- it's just so fun!  It can get a little tedious at times, like when I try to do one thing (get at a particular witch, for example) but just get killed over and over.  Or if I mistakenly steal something.  But - that's part of the deal with this type of game.  I know this review doesn't do it justice, I just wanted another 5 stars up there for this EXCELLENT game!!!!!!"
"My husband and I are both enjoying the game and have been since it came out.  Entertaining and a good rpg that lets me take my character where ever I want her to go.  Downside, the NPC are not as good as the ones in FA  NV but they are far better than previous Bethesda Elder Scrolls.  Upside, there is enough to do that I'll be playing this for a long time.  Have the two DLC's and looking forward to the next one."
"Talk about an intense start to a video game! You begin your quest in the back of a horse and cart on your way to be executed. Of course, the entire time I'm thinking ""shortest video game ever!"" Luckily not so, thank the stars. You manage to escape thanks to the help of a random dragon attack. This leads its way into the tutorial section of the game, which is much needed, even for those of us who have played one version or another of elder scrolls. So much has changed from previous versions, for the better I would say.A few improvements:Dual wield- it was about time. This isn't just limited to weapons either, you can have two different types of magic going on at the same time. Sweet! Only downside, it can make cycling through weapons/spells more difficult.The map offers more of a 3-d approach. It is much easier to tell where mountains and other topographical landmarks are, although it makes navigating more challenging (in my opinion).Better graphics- everything seems much improved, especially the mines and towns. The interactivity is amazing as you no longer have to open up a door to enter a town, you simply walk right in and talk to townspeople.Back to the story...One of your captors leads you through a tunnel and you are then set free to roam about Skyrim. So far I'vemade my way to 2 towns, defeated a group of bandits and collected a bounty for defeating the leader (a nice new addition by the way), and completed several small sidequests. I'm sure this game will provide limitless hours of fun and entertainment as it already has."
"Bethesda has really put a lot of time and effort into this game. 5-6 years of development really has paid off and made this game into possibly what is going to be one of the most addicting games I own. Great game I highly recommend it.The detail they put into it was crazy. Most of them are unnecessary for a game but for a realistic game like the elder scrolls, it is necessary. I would pay 80 dollars for this game if I had to. Totally worth it."
This blows it away!  Love this game!  This would be the one game that I would want with on a desert island if I had electricity.
"This game is hands down fantastic.  I haven't beaten it yet, I've been too busy slaughtering trolls, picking flowers, exploring caves, catching dragonflies, killing werewolves, killing werewolf hunters, killing hunters, hunting killers, stealing from the rich and giving to the poor, stealing from the poor for the rich, getting rich, shouting at dragons, picking locks, picking sides, switching sides, switching weapons, making weapons, enchanting weapons, catching fish, mining ore, smelting iron, etc.  This game has a bit of something for anyone and can accomodate any playstyle.  I'd go on, except I took an arrow in the knee while someone was stealing my sweetroll."
"Skyrim takes what made the past Elder Scrolls games great, and raises the bar in such a way that is rarely seen in today's games. Not just another sequel, Skyrim engrosses you into a charming world that is as large as it is engaging. The new engine called Radiant (Bethesda used to license GameBryo for all their open world games, including the Elder Scrolls and Fallout IP's) brings the world to life with massive environments, fantastic details, and simply makes walking around in the wilderness enjoyable. If you value a game for its replay value, then this game is THE jackpot. There is so much to do, so many main and sidequests, so much to interact with, so many weapons, armor, and items to collect- it's simply insane. You'll be sucked into Skyrim and it simply will not let you go; this game can easily take hundreds, upon hundreds, of hours to play- and even then you may not complete every single quest or mission or find every special piece of armor or weapons.I've played Morrowind, Oblivion, and now Skyrim; and although I liked the previous games, Skyrim, in my opinion, is by far superior and funner to play than the others. Combat simply feels better in Skyrim and not so stiff as the previous games. Staggering opponents when you strike them feels more natural, you can perform these awesome execution kills now where the camera pulls back in slow motion and you're character can do things like drive a sword right through an enemy or even decapitate an opponent completely. The new perk system is also fantastic and makes you wonder how you ever played the previous games without it. You can earn a perk unlock every time you level up, and there are tons of perks to choose from; anything from being able to decapitate foes with one handed weapons, to being able to run faster with heavy armor, to being able to smith new weapons and armor, included dragon armor- the best armor in the game.This one is memorable, and even if you aren't an Elder Scrolls fan, you should just get this game if you have even the smallest interest in adventure games."
"I have been wanting this game for a while and finally got it. SO after about 1 month of play I don't feel I'm close to done! If you have the money buy it now! I was thinking it wouldn't be as good as some of the reviewers said because it is a few years old now.Skyrim is the place you play on. It has a ton of town plus 9 major cities called 'Holds"". As you travel around freely you will come across Forts, Hunting Traps, Mill, Cabins, and about and think you can think of.There is really no 'good guys' but each thinks a different way. So you must choose what side you want to be on, if you want to be peaceful or deadly, and pick if you want to steal or give.After playing for awhile you will learn the people of Skyrim and who you like and who you don't. Just like real life.So this is one of my favorite games and that's why I give this life like game a 5/5!"
"I guess I'm one of the people who this game just doesn't suit. It's technically amazing and looks great, but something about the gameplay just turns me off. Weird, because I love the Fallout series. Maybe it's just because it wants so much of my time and I'm subconsciously fighting back!I have to say I like it somewhat, but other games have taken their place in front of this for me."
"I am much more of a FPS type guy, but Skyrim definitely takes the place of my favorite game ever. I was skeptical of getting an RPG game because I thought it might be boring, but Skyrim is far from that. There is so much content for the value, plus all the download expansions are amazing. The role playing element is much more intriguing than I thought it would be. I've never had so much fun building a virtual home in a video game. You can essentially choose whatever path you like and make your character just like you."
"I have limited history with The Elder Scrolls.  I know that statement may diminish my opinion in the eyes of some, but I have been a video game fanatic for forty years and I can say Skyrim is, without question, the greatest video game I've ever played.  I know that's a subjective statement, but of the thousands of games I have played none have compared to the excitement, thrill, and awe I feel playing this game.  Skyrim has awesome graphics (the landscapes are simply stunning), a terrific main story, quirky, interesting NPCs, and a general depth and detail I've never seen in a game before. I continue to play Skyrim, a game I have owned literally since the day it came out, at the expense of newer games simply because even after all this time I have yet to unlock everything the game has to offer and that's all I can ask for in a game."
"It is a classic, it is a nice game, very good and amazingly big, it is like you never finish playing."
"Fantastic game with hundreds and hundreds of hours worth of game content.Graphically amazing, fantastic audio, compelling gameplay and a solid story. If you enjoyed Oblivion or Morrowind you should love this, if you haven't played either you really should try this anyway.My girlfriend even started up a character and has been giving it a go and she is NOT a gamer even remotely.Maybe I'm fortunate but I really have had very few glitches or issues with the game, and the ones I have had have literally been a couple of game freezes on my OG 360.Steer clear of the ps3 version until they get a handle on the framerate issues (if they ever do) but definitely give this game a go!"
"After playing this excessively for several months, I only, slightly, became un-interested.  The in-game is so large and so beautiful, it's really not that bad to jog everywhere - which I do; I think I tried a horse ride once and was like, &#34;nope&#34;.  The character customization, weapon options, fighting styles, and other learned abilities are plenty - I'm surprised they got all that data on one disc.  Would have been sweet to see a &#34;new game plus&#34; option."
"I know I'm not supposed to say this, but I'm an honest person: I didn't like Oblivion. I found it tedious and repetitive. I loved Fallout 3 and New Vegas, however. Does that redeem me? Probably not.That being said, I love Skyrim. It's an absolute blast. The world is massive, populated and interesting. The main quest-lines are interesting and fun. The side quests are more interesting and more fun. Thankfully, the Xbox 360 version of Skyrim is not as populated with bugs as the PS3 version, but it still has some of Bethesda's early-adopter ""bonuses"" sprinkled around.Like fantasy? Enjoy creative, immersive worlds? Have a lot of free time available? One-Click this game and get to work.Good: Great graphics, awesome music, incredible depth, creative leveling system, endless gameplay, a myriad ways to play the game.Bad: Sometime frustrating aiming, odd glitches, Bethesda's early-adopter ""bonuses""."
"This game has it all, graphics, sound quality, gameplay etc. With the huge widespread of land, medieval times, and dragons roaming around in the sky. With the new ability to obtain dragons and fly them around makes the map way easier to explore and look for games. The sound quality with the dragon roars and troll grunts, making the game a lot more interesting. I highly recommend this game to people who enjoy exploring worlds, finding new material, and taming dragons. I personally think this game is a 10/10."
"seems to make my xbox heat up pretty quickly, but maybe trhats just my xbox. otherwise the game works great."
It's hard to even describe the graphics of this game. The best way to describe them is to... not try! You should just kind of check it out for yourself.My only problem with the game is that I lost all my friends playing it. I have got to quit. It's too addictive. Moreso than previous RPGs I have played. Shame on the developers! :-p
"While this review is long overdue, I felt that in order to give a complete and honest overview of this title, I would have to accomplish several things; 1) beat the main quest, 2) reach a moderately high level, and 3), play for at least 100 hours. After about 130 hours, and at level 40, I finally completed the main quest. Not because the main quest takes that long, but really all the stuff in between became so intoxicating, as is typical for this series. It should be noted that with this review, I draw comparisons with past installments (mainly Morrowind and Oblivion). Now, without further adieu...My first TES title was Morrowind. Before its release, I remember daydreaming about its proposed possibilities, and I would try to imagine what sort of character I would be (not just my class, but more importantly, how I would interact with the game's characters). When I first got a chance to play the thing on my old xbox, I remember the simultaneous feelings of being overwhelmed by its massive size and underwhelmed by its limited and stilted dialogue options. Morrowind was in the end a game one had to invest themselves in completely in order to reap its eventual rewards, and as many fans of that title can attest, it had rewards aplenty. Skyrim, by contrast, is a much more accessible game, and one that, while not revolutionary in its design, does refine many areas that were previously unpolished in the series.Story and StorytellingCompared to previous installments, the overall presentation is much more polished, and is as a result the game has a much more compelling sense of drama, if not outright urgency. Bethesda have never been truly great storytellers, but Skyrim takes a few steps in the right direction, even if it still can't compete with a Bioware title in this regard. The series has always had excellent lore, however, and the added flair in the presentation highlights this wonderfully for those who have played the previous games but have never taken the time to read the volumes of books found in-game. Skyrim, like its predecessors, continues and builds upon the well established and incredibly deep backstory of its world. While exploring, one should take the time to read the many books and notes not just for their added benefit of skill upgrades, but also for their well-written tales and histories. With that said, Skyrim has the benefit of not only detailed lore, but also utilizes competent story-telling techniques; a first for the series. While the main plot is ordinary enough (dragons, who were once thought only a legend, have returned!-how often have we heard that one before?), its presentation is much more immediate and cinematic compared to previous TES games, and doesn't sacrifice the series's treasured non-linearity. On top of this, Bethesda wisely chose to take a few notes from Morrowind's main quest, and add a more subtle, and morally gray counterpart to the dragons; a bitter civil war. The political intrigue adds greatly to the drama, but it also serves to highlight just how dangerous the world of Skyrim really is. In this way, the dragons become symbolic of the complex political machinations that have taken root, as opposed to simply being fantasy fodder or eye candy (though they accomplish this, as well). The main story is actually quite satisfying, even if its pacing is hindered by the very strengths that make this series great. While I can't say I became truly attached to any one character, I enjoyed being a part of it, and certain quests have a dramatic flair to them that is engaging. Skyrim's main story does not have quite the level of nuance and detail as Morrowind's, but it is much more involved and compelling.In typical fashion, the sidequests ultimately rule the day. They are generally short, but take more narrative chances than the larger surrounding tale. One can easily spend hours ignoring the main plot in favor of these quests, or vise versa. How you play is ultimately up to you.Dragons, Dragons, and DragonsWhen it was offically announced that TES V would have dragons, and would take place in the province of Skyrim, my enthusiasm for the project was immediate. Ever since I started strolling across the wastes of Vvardenfell in TES III: Morrowind, I always fancied the thought of dragons making an appearance in the series. To be honest, however, when it was announced that dragons would be both random and unlimited in quantity, I feared that they were simply the game's equivalent to TES IV's Oblivion Gates (ie; repetitive and lazily inserted into the main plot). On a superficial level, this may not seem far from the truth. They are random, for one, and their presence can impede your progress if you choose to confront them. On the other hand, the dragons of Skyrim are a delight to see in action, and are not tedious or superfluous, despite their regularity. This is aided by the fact that unlike the Oblivion Gates, dragons fights in Skyrim are usually quick and yes, epic. As far as video game dragons go, Skyrim's are among the best not only in design, but also function, since the rewards for slaying them are both practical and viscerally satisfying. Each time you defeat one, you will absorb its soul, and will be able to unlock a word among any of the dragon shouts you've learned on your travels. Its a simple yet effective mechanic, and I swear, I never grow tired of seeing enemies plunge to their deaths from tall cliffs as I unleash Unrelenting Force before them, so the shouts themselves are useful in a way that complements the already satisfying magic system. While it would have been nice to see more types of dragons (and also more varied environments in which one can find them...like in a cave with dragon-lings or perhaps even an underwater dragon...), their presence is welcome, and seeing one flying in the distance is almost always a visual treat. Regrettably, dragons are a little too easy to slay, and don't become truly challenging until higher levels.Streamlined or Dumbed-Down?One of the more controversial directions taken was the 'streamlining' of the character creation and progression systems, which typically is code for 'dumbed-down' or 'made console friendly' for CRPG enthusiasts like myself. While it may seem like Skyrim has been 'dumbed-down' in its character progression/level-up system, one has to really think about what TES's system has tried to do since Daggerfall. That is...having one's skills progress intuitively with play, rather than having players assign numbers to a character sheet. In the past, level progress was determined by attaining ten skill increases in one's Major Skills. By utilizing a classless system and removing Major and Minor skills, Bethesda have essentially taken out the middle man. Skyrim's system is simply less redundant than previous iterations. Now, your actions in the game world are more directly tied to your character's progression, rather than having to be filtered through artificial labels and decisions inserted in the beginning of the game. Apart from taking away some of the joy of seeing a complex character sheet, the only other noticeable fault is that by removing Major and Minor skills, one cannot as easily dictate the speed of their character's progress, meaning that all skills, whether they are preferential or not to one's play style, will contribute to a level-up. In this sense, Morrowind and Daggerfall are still superior in terms of character customization (greater breadth), but Skyrim's is nothing to cry about. There are still a ridiculous amount of options available, and some of the cuts (such as acrobatics) were actually intelligent decisions from the developers (I'll be the first to admit that a part of me misses jumping across the land like a fool, but I can also respect the realism that comes with its exclusion). I also am somewhat saddened by the lack of spell creation, but honestly, the spells in Skyrim are much more functional now (especially when compared to Oblivion's...). The initial character creation screen is, as a result, surprisingly quick. Now, you simply choose your race, sex, name and appearance, but you do not create your class from the get-go. Rather, you create your character's class as you play. It's really a subtle change, but one that benefits the game overall.Despite the amount of fun I had with it, one of Oblivion's fatal flaws that I never quite got over was its level scaling, which cast a large shadow over the gameplay. Skyrim does have level scaling, but it has been implemented much more thoughtfully. One of the challenges designers face when creating a huge, open world 'RPG' like an Elder Scrolls title is maintaining a degree of challenge throughout while allowing players to explore at their own pace. One method is to place creatures at fixed levels in areas that are not intended to be explored until the player can competently face them (ala Gothic 1 and 2), and yet another is to scale monsters to the player's level (ala Oblivion), which encourages exploration in a non-linear game, but also trivializes the process of leveling up. In Skyrim, one will advance in level and see more challenging enemies, but the lower level ones will remain, meaning that you will not encounter level 40 wolves and mubcrabs, nor will you see mere bandits running around in daedric armor (another tragedy from Oblivion). You will, however, encounter some higher level forms of certain common enemies like bandits and draugr. What this means is that Skyrim remains reasonably challenging throughout (unlike Morrowind), but does not take away one's sense of accomplishment from attaining the higher levels (unlike Oblivion). My one complaint is that most loot is still leveled, meaning one can find measly amounts of gold even in locked chests.The interface, at least on the 360, has been greatly simplified for use with a gamepad. It's graceful and intuitive, though as one can imagine, less so with a keyboard and mouse (PC users, can, and should mod this feature if they find it inadequate). My one complaint is that after a while, as one accumulates vast amounts of loot, organization can become messy and certain items (especially potions) can be difficult to find quickly. The quick-menu helps, but sometimes not enough.But Is It an RPG?Due to the simplification of its leveling system, which inevitably heralded the cries of many diehard RPG players like myself, questions abound as to whether Skyrim is a 'true' RPG. Simply put; no. But then again, TES has never fully embraced the more conservative notions of what an RPG is. The key words in RPG are 'role-play,' and while one certainly has many options regarding what role they wish to play in Skyrim's world, the character interaction is, like past iterations, very limited in its scope. Indeed, parallel to Bethesda's limited emphasis on story and story-telling is also a stunted sense of character. Daggerfall's was awkward and mechanical, Morrowind's was merely functional, and Oblivion's, well, it was hardly functional, but also very awkward. Skyrim's, is, while limited, at least more graceful. Still, most characters you meet will be forgotten quickly. Do not expect to get too attached to your companions, as their vocabulary is limited and their words few. While character interaction isn't the only thing that separates the RPG from the FPS, it is a fundamental quality. Skyrim (like other TES titles), frankly, is a game that does not fit into easy categories. It is part RPG, part adventure, part action (and hack n' slash), and part sandbox/openworld. But really, it's genre is inconsequential because Skyrim is simply fun to play, despite its limitations. If one approaches Skyrim expecting deep characterization, meaningful subtext and relations with the world and other characters therein, you may be disappointed. If you want these qualities, you will want to play a game like the Witcher 1/2, Dragon Age, Planescape Torment, Fallout 1/2, Baldur's Gate, etc. Skyrim's greatness lies primarily in its sense of discovery and scope. While playing, small, non-scripted moments will come and go that make the game's world come alive. For me, in one such instance I was simply strolling across the fields west of Whiterun. The stars were out, as were the twin moons Masser and Secunda, and across the horizon red and green bands of celestial light swayed over the northern mountains. From that distance, it looked small, but a dragon could be seen dancing across the air towards some unknown destination. It was pure magic, and it was all for me.World DesignAfter Morrowind's strange and twisted vistas, Bethesda reverted back to a more conventional fantasy setting with Oblivion. While it was beautiful and featured an amazing draw distance (for the time), the world map in Oblivion felt strangely flat and monotonous, and it was almost as if Bethesda made it too realistic for its own good. Skyrim's setting, while realistic to a degree, is majestic and awe-inspiring in its design and scope. Along with having a greater variety of environments, Skyrim's world feels larger than Oblivion's, even though they are similar in size according to the developers. This is probably thanks to one feature; mountains, and lots of them. It's really the same tactic Bethesda used to make Morrowind's Vvardenfell feel so large and all-encompassing, and it works wonderfully here. The world of Skyrim is mystical and vast, but does not betray our willingness to mistake it for a real place. In short, the world of Skyrim finds a balance between Morrowind's majesty and Oblivion's naturalism. The results are nothing short of stunning, and I have no doubt that nature-porn addicts will drool incessantly with this title.Aesthetics: Visuals and AudioVisually, The Elder Scrolls series has always been a mixed bag, and in a technical sense, Skyrim is not much different. There are glaring, low resolution textures (most of which have been fixed for the 360, thankfully), awkward character animations and lip syncing, and other visual oddities which keep Skyrim from attaining the same kind of visual fidelity that one will find in a game like Crysis 1/2. What Skyrim has in spades, however, unlike many of its technical superiors, is aesthetic beauty. Skyrim has hands down some of the best art direction I have ever seen in a fantasy-themed videogame. From the ancient norse-inspired architecture and armor, to the snow-capped mountains and flowing rivers, Skyrim's achingly beautiful world owes itself to its accomplished and mature visual aesthetic. No matter how many hours I put into this game, I find myself repeatedly stopping to admire the view. Going out at night and seeing the aurora borealis is practically a religious experience, and when you combine this with Jeremy Soule's most eclectic and inspired soundtrack since Icewind Dale, you get a gaming experience that is sublime. Keyword: experience.The sound effects are mostly standard, though a few stand out such as those for explosions and spells. Sound-wise, where Skyrim really stands out is in its music and voice acting. While you will still hear the same voice actor for different roles, it is nowhere near as intrusive as Oblivion's limited cast. Adding top class actors like Christopher Plummer and Max von Sydow into the mix did not hurts matters, either. Given the size of this game, the amount of dialogue and voice actors one hears is quite impressive, and most lines are delivered with ample enthusiasm. Because the presentation for character interaction isn't on par with a game like Mass Effect, however, some of this is lost in translation, and the music, as gorgeous as it is, has a tendency to overpower the actors, but these are small issues in the end. Skrim's is easily among the best video game soundtracks I've heard in a long time.ConclusionOverall, Skyrim is not a far cry from earlier titles, but it does refine some points and expand upon others. I'd rank it right beside Morrowind's lofty position, though each game offers players something that the other can't. Morrowind has more character possibilities and of course, levitation. Then again, Morrowind's world (it's NPCs and their relationship with the environment and story) were much more flat compared to Skyrim's. If anything, Skyrim combines Oblivion's accessibility with Morrowind's more intelligent story and character progression. Is Skyrim the best RPG of all time? No. But again, it doesn't have to be, since apart from Daggerfall, TES games have never been truly 'hardcore' RPGs, but rather a hybrid of the genre that includes elements of adventure, sandbox gameplay, and action. For my money, it's the best Bethesda product since Morrowind, and that alone should make fans happy."
"There are plenty of reviews here on Amazon stating how good this game is...  I agree that this is one of THE BEST games I have ever played, especially on the Xbox 360.The main problem with the game is that there are too many bugs.  I could live with most of the minor bugs and I was able to complete the main quest in the game.  I have a level 54 character and I have been trying to complete the mid-level and side quests to get all of the achievements.The problem is, I seem to have encountered a bug that is preventing me from completing these quests.  The bug seems to happen in one of two places.  I am doing the Dark Brotherhood line of quests that requires you to kill people in towns.  This puts a bounty on your head.  Now, when I go to those towns, the guards come up to me and give me three options:  1. Pay the fine, 2. Go to Jail.  3. Resist Arrest.If I choose option 1 or 2, my Xbox locks hard.  The screen freezes and I have to power off my xbox and restart from the last save.I was willing to live with this since I could choose option 3, and just kill the guards.  (Which would raise my bounty further.)  In some towns, I would have the option to bribe the guards since I became leader of the Thieves Guild.  That would work, but I didn't get the option in all towns.But now, while trying to complete the Dark Brotherhood quest line, I am getting the hard lockup when I have to get into the coffin with the mother for the second time.  (Towards the end of the questline.)It seems to be when the game is automatically trying to take me somewhere.  Like when I am being arrested, or I assume when I am in the mother coffin.I have another Xbox and will try it out there...  But, my thought is that the Xbox is a closed system.  I have not modified my Xbox or my game, so I should not be getting these hard lockups or the multitude of other bugs.Again...  One of the best games I have ever played.  Just wish I could finish it.  (I would also like to play the DLC, but I WILL NOT buy it if I cannot get by these lockup bugs."
"Greetings!  Yes, this game is ridiculously great.  I'll put this review down in three short parts: (1) for those who are new to the Elder Scrolls; (2) for the veterans of Elder Scrolls / Fallout 3 / sandbox games; (3) general thoughts and comments about the game itself.Quick background: I was madly in love with Morrowind and Fallout 3; I wasn't too crazy about Oblivion for many reasons, which are irrelevant right now.  I loathe standard FPS games with linear storytelling and rinse-repeat trigger-twitching action.  I play old school dungeons and dragons (paper and pencils, yes) and Lord of the Rings is the greatest fantasy tale ever (along with the Belgariad).(1) For the unblooded: the open world of Skyrim can and will be daunting; you aren't given any clear-cut goals--or maybe you're given too many!  That deer in the headlights, ""what do I do now?"", sensation is perfectly normal.  Sit back and imagine yourself in an alternate reality; exactly, now you have it!  Figure out the controls and character management stuff (read the dang manual!) and the rest is completely up to your imagination!  Save your game often (every time you do something, basically) and experiment with anything you can think of; in no time flat, you'll realize this game is amazing.(2) For the grognards: assuming you've played Morrowind, Oblivion, and Fallout 3, then Skyrim will feel comfy.  It feels bigger and more inspiring thanks to the soaring mountains and the astounding soundtrack.  The action is fantastic and the new addition of trigger dual-wielding is a lot of fun--experiment with all the combinations (like smacking a foe with fire & ice spells simultaneously).Bethesda really simplified character creation and levelling, but they added in a robust Perk tree for every skill that presents a bewildering array of choices; I mean bewildering in that it's agonizing to choose which one to choose!  The Perks actually have a dramatic impact on the game though, so whatever direction you go is bound to be exciting.The interface is a lot cleaner and easier to access than any game before, including Fallout.  I'd say Skyrim is closer to Fallout in terms of how it feels when you're playing, but the world feels unique and interesting like it was in Morrowind; the best of both worlds, baby.  Dragons are fantasy at its best, and they feel appropriately tough.  The best encounters come when the dragon roars and swoops overhead, building up that anticipation; there are different types of them, so be wary if you beat one down easily because the next one might not be so cake.(3) General thoughts: I haven't had the game crash, not even once.  The load times off the HDD are less than 30 seconds and much shorter for small transitions like shops.  There are definitely some graphic hiccups and texture issues, but it's not constant nor bad enough to break the spell of immersion.  There is so much to do in this game that you could easily stay in one province of Skyrim and max out your level.Be careful with the difficulty setting, as some enemies are nearly indestructable on anything but normal, whereas the toughest enemies are sometimes far too easy when the difficulty is lowered.  You'll notice classic Elder Scroll follies, like a bandit kingpin beating you down faster than a pair of angry dragons--but that's present in almost every game that tries to keep it challenging.  It's better than Oblivion and much more like Fallout 3.The best character and most amazing thing about Skyrim is the world itself.  I've spent time simply gazing at the aurora lights or galactic clouds visible in the night sky; I've stood atop a lonely mountain in a snowstorm and just listened to the noise; I've stalked massive elk through sun-dappled pine forests; I've floated on an iceberg in the Sea of Ghosts, watching veils of fog swallow the land; I've walked with herds of mammoths across the tundra; I've delved into forgotten, undead-haunted halls where the slightest noise sends chills up your spine.Enjoy, my friends."
"This review is pretty late but I feel I need to write one.Elder Scrolls V Skyrim is a huge and I mean HUGE improvement from its predecessor Elder Scrolls IV Oblivion.  I played Oblivion but could not seem to want to finish.  I played Skyrim and I can't seem to want put it down for good.  I've downloaded each expansion and played through the game several times each experience different then the other.The best part about this game much like Bethesda's Fallout series is not one play through of this game is the same as another.  You have so many choices and so many random events that Skyrim never gets old.  The downloadable content adds much more hours of gameplay and fun.Here's the Pros and ConsPro:Graphics:  Beautiful!  Not groundbreaking by any means.  I can tell Skyrim is running on a modified Oblivion engine but the life like and vibrant textures of the world are simply amazing.  I love the colors of the forests and plants and especially the dirt patches and snow.  Simply realistic looking.Voice Acting:  Superb.  The best voicing I've heard from Bethesda yet.  I enjoy the way people in the game go about their daily lives in the background of my story and I love walking through peoples conversations.  The voices are very believable and not overdone sounding.Gameplay:  A big difference from the last installment.  The fighting is much less clumsy and more accurate and balanced.  I really feel like I'm doing more than walking up to someone and pressing a button for a single slash from my sword.  There hacking slashing shield play and even duel weapons and magic.  The gameplay &#34;feels&#34; much more comfortable and sensitive.Story:  The story while not as earth changing as the Oblivion Crisis and more exclusive to the region is really awesome.Con:Bugs:  While no game is without it's share of bugs, and bethesda games (Fallout and Elder Scrolls) seem to have a lot this one is no different.  The Oblivion engine plagued the first Xbox 360 console release with burned out processors, red ring of death and killer overheating.  This of course was solved by a new fan and better hardware it seems the engine is still a little hard is some areas for graphic acceleration.  My most hated but is when you enter an area and instead of loading is just freezes.  This occured of course in Fallout 3 and new Vegas but seemed more prevalent in skyrim.Well that was my only gripe.  I really love Skyrim that much.  I would say the lack of more downloadable content is a con but...not really the expansions are huge and add tons and tons more things to the game."
"I played D&D; growing up and as RPG's came out on computers I always wanted a game that had content, great graphics, detailed character development and outstanding sounds. Skyrim delivers. I can honestly say that at this point, Bethesda has fulfilled a childhood dream of mine and made a deeply immersive and satisfying RPG that you can lose yourself in.A really quick note on the graphics, I have 2 televisions I am playing this on. One is a 65 inch plasma. The other is a 73 inch DLP. Both televisions tend to make games look poorly just because they are so big that the games become more pixalated and they do not look as detailed. I am thrilled to report that this game looks fantastic on both of my televisions. However, I have not installed them to the harddrive and I just read on the Bethesda forum that they are telling you NOT to install it on the harddrive yet as there is a bug that won't import all the textures and your graphics will suffer. So for the time being play off the disc itself.The menu system has been changed from Oblivion and for me it is much easier to navigate. The fighting has the same mechanics, but is now more realistic. Easy enemies are taken down with a blow or two.What I find odd, and this may be a bug is that when I am playing a male character and I change my FOV so that I can see my character, he is further away from the screen than when my wife is playing a female and wants to see her character. Her female takes up a good portion of the screen and only resizes smaller when she gets into a fighting stance.Gameplay is seriously entertaining although this is not a hack and slash game full of energy. It is a game where you will spend a lot of time exploring the world, rooms and objects in the room such as barrels and chests. It definitely is not an action game. It is about character development, exploration and finishing quests. If you are looking for an arcade, fast paced game this isn't going to be the game for you. For me, this game is one where as time goes on you feel more accomplished because you created an original character with skills that have progressed because you used them all throughout the game. If you use a two handed weapon all the time, you will be better with them than someone who duel wields all the time. If you make 10000 potions, you will be much better than someone who has made 500.My wife doesn't typically like games. Some she enjoys watching while I play. She is playing this one and she is really liking it. That is how good this game is."
"I love this game a lot. It has amazing graphics and a much better fighting style compared to Oblivion. The overall gameplay is very impressive, and the main quest isn't too tedious and actually helps your character improve a lot by giving your character new useful shouts, such as Dragonrend. There is plenty to do when you get bored, and there are some comical things about this particular game, such as the fact that if you put baskets on shop keepers' heads, you can easily steal items in the shop without being caught, as long as the basket remains on their head. Your choices can have a pretty big impact on the game, especially if you have bought all of the DLC for it. It's a great game, I'm very impressed with it and cannot wait for the next Elder Scrolls game."
"There isn't much to say that hasn't already been said about this game! This game is so much fun on so many levels! It was beautifully made, and the graphics are top notch! The possibilities for &#34;things to do&#34; in this game are almost limitless! I find myself never getting bored playing this game. There are so many skills to train, so many things to craft, buy, wear, kill and explore that you really have to invest a hefty amount of time to be able to experience a big chunk that this game delivers! The world of Skyrim is so vast and incredible that i found a large portion of my time devoted to just exploring. There's so much bang for your buck in this game that it really sells itself!"
"I was trying to level up my athletics to 100 and I got stuck around 98. Is that a glitch or is it just going to take a while? I walk and run all over skyrim and rarely fast travel so I'm not sure what the problem is.Also, why didn't they include the adoring fan in this one? He was my absolute favorite character. The jarl gave me Lidia but she talked too much so I lured her into the woods so that as soon as a goat attacked I could shoot her in the head while she was busy with the goat. I hope the dlc includes the adoring fan.Ok one last thing, I stole a horse from white run and climbed up the throat of the world and jumped off and for some reason the horse died. Is that a glitch?"
"Two words: Blown away.Skyrim has gone above and beyond my expectations. I've been watching all of the preview videos, live streams, etc. but now that I finally got my hands on this I'm amazed. The upgrades they've made over Oblivion, the sheer beauty of the graphics engine, the interaction with the people, the fighting system, the leveling system, the quests... just the sheer amount of things to do. What can I say, call me a fan.Enough gushing, right? So what's wrong with the game: the melee combat is better than Oblivion but still not perfect. It would be very hard to nail perfect, but hey, I enjoy it as is. Some weird glitches happen every so often (mainly with NPCs wigging out). There's also texture pop-up and some muddy looking things when you look up really close, but that goes without saying since the whole world is loaded when you walk outside. One last little gripe is when you go from building to building you have to wait for a load time every time, gets kind of annoying when I'm trying to rob people blind by going house to house.That's it. Other than that I'm thrilled with this game. It's a beautiful joy to play and I highly recommend it for anyone that's ever been interested in an RPG before. Being able to go where you please and do whatever you want is so much fun, and believe me, I've been taking full advantage of it."
Must buy for any gamer. Even if you're not into Elder Scrolls (as i was) this is still the best game in this franchise!
It's unbelievable how they can create such a huge wonderful game on a small disc.  It is immense and beautiful and full of different adventures.
"Words can describe how good this game really is. If I try to write a review, I simply won't be doing the game justice."
"As an avid gamer since the year 1989, up until recent years where adult life has consumed most of my time in monotonies such as work and a home, Skyrim came unexpectedly.Skyrim is in my opinion the best game I have ever played.To begin with, the massive world you'll notice is as visceral as ever in its quasi-fantasy style. Cyrodil was mostly grass and vegetation, Skyrim has beautiful villages and sunny landscapes which contrast with harsh, hostile snow-covered mountains, violent ravines and breath-taking waterfalls. This time the land is bigger than ever, and frighteningly detailed. There were many people working on the maps in every city and it really shows. Quite honestly, you haven't seen anything like this before, not in Morrowind or Oblivion.Straight up, the fourth sequel in the Elder Scrolls series throws an enormous amount at the player and gives them so much to do, in such a way that you are rewarded for doing anything and everything. Your character progresses and advances the more you play. Dynamics are the most important part of the game. Whatever you experience, those skills will increase as you get naturally stronger, with the ability to add a ""perk"" to a skill tree once you have so many skill points. The perks can change the game and the player will enjoy picking the best ones. Levelling up can become an addiction, severing many hours with the ""just one more"" factor.There are dozens of ways to approach quests, and if you don't want to follow the main story that's OK too. Your character can level up in other ways by doing what the hell you want, whether that being a merchant who sells his own gear, or a violent thug who robs and pillages. You can sneak, assault with double handed or one handed weapons, use destruction spells, snipe with arrows, conjure up beasts to do fighting for you, poison your foes pockets... and so much more. There are also skills in smithing weapons, alchemy, alteration, and even enchanting. Put simply, you will need to kill hundreds of hours before you become anywhere near bored.Skyrim has massively improved areas which weren't perfect about Oblivion. The AI moves like an action/adventure game as opposed to an RPG. Before, enemies used to stand on the spot as you hit them. Now, they side-strafe and dash forward to attack, blocking with shields. Some even run away if they know they're going to die. They use spells intelligently and heal up as often as the player does. The random encounters are also sometimes hilarious even if you fall foul to them. Random fights, muggings and robberies can happen at any time. Walk along a mountain path and wonder as a dragon lands at your feet and toasts you. Behold as giants and mammoths come together to ward off bandits. It really does keep the game refreshing and new. I've also heard of weddings in this game which get gate-crashed.Skyrim really flooded my senses with wonder and intrigue which I really enjoyed and still continue to think about even after I completed the main quest. The game rewards the player for completing each guild and side quests. There is so much to do, with so much content it makes going back to the standard 10-hour game disappointing and flat. Warning, this game can be very addictive. The only downside I would say is the loading times which can't be helped, although they do help to relax you with a fabulous score.10/10"
"One of my favorite games from one of my favorite developers.  I love the amazing quests and world of Skyrim, you can get lost with how vast it is.  It's such a fun game, any RPG lover should give it a try."
This game will keep you busy for a long time.  I had 100+ hours on my play through.  Be sure to get the Dawn Guard DLC
"This game is fantastic. It's creative, innovative, and fun.I'm going to list pros and cons, even though it's hard to think of cons..Pros--The graphics are absolutely phenomenal.-The music score in this game is the best in any game I have ever played.-The weapons are awesome. I love the upgrading system.-Just like Oblvion, the world in Skyrim is huge and open for you to do whatever you want.-The dark brotherhood questline is SO SO SO good. If you're buying this game please do thost quests immediately.Cons--I would have enjoyed a more emotionally enticing story. The story is great and creative, but it didn't really make you feel anything. I want a game's story to move me.-I feel like one of the few areas where this game lacks in comparison to Oblivion is that it feels less diverse as far as people go. Oblivion was a melting pot of races and this one is mostly nords with a few others. The other races are a lot uglier in Skyrim than in Oblivion though.Even with the cons, skyrim is brilliant and worth every penny. I have logged in hours upon hours of gameplay and will continue to do so. 5/5 easily."
"Don't think anyone is going to read this, but if you are then this is meant to be a brief review. I'm just rating for the sake of just that. After doing much research here on Amazon, then playing Skyrim for myself I have to say that All the 5 Star Reviews Are Right when saying this game has lived up to the hype and is the greatest RPG on xBox360. Skyrim stretched the consoles capabilities to the limits with it's vast open world, stupendous graphics, and arsenal of unending quest/things to do. This game is worth the $ for sure and a *five***Stars* in my book.There's a lot of complaints I noticed on Amazon about the gamebreaks, freezing, bugs, etc..... I only ran into one Freeze and I'm 70 hours in and completed the main story. This is my advice since this is something I practiced in Morrowind that may help prevent these little hickups. Biggest thing is don't litter too much when playing Skyrim. When you don't need an item sell it to a merchant, try not to throw it on the ground because the game then has to remember that the item was left there. This causes the game to work slightly harder and can cause more loading+potential freezing/glitches. Just something that has worked for me idk it may work for anyone else. Also I only use 4 save files when playing Skyrim. 1 is master save file where I physically have to click save (it's been rewritten 450 times, yeah I save a lot.) The other 3 are auto saves that the game does consistently. Again this is another technique I practice when playing a vast game as this because it makes less that has to be remembered.Here's a funny incident when I did litter in a town. One of the guards saw me do it then approached me saying ""Hey you can't leave that there go pick it up"". Might be Bethesda hinting on the topic : DAny who it's a great game and you can get it for cheap in the used section. Now to end this review with my own personal dragon shout to you concerning buying the game  ""GO FO IT!"""
"Time passes really fast when you are playing this game.  The first six hours went by in the blink of an eye yesterday ... my character is at level 10 and I feel like I have barely scratched the surface of anything.  If you like these kinds of games, you will be hooked because Bethesda has managed to create something which really nails it on every level.  I am a heavily magic oriented player so I spent most of my time so far in the mages' guild in winterhold.  For some reason though the Dark Brotherhood wants me dead and sent an assassin to kill me.  I was just messing around with some conjuration spells in a forest glen and the assassin was killed by this flame creature I had conjured before I even knew what was going on.  Looted the body and found a note saying they want me dead.  Stuff like that just happens and it is awesome.  Dungeons btw are really fun and very well designed.I do have one gripe that I see has been addressed by some other reviewers who gave a low rating for the game on amazon.  That is that you have to pause the action to switch spells.  In Oblivion, I could instantly switch spells with the d-pad and then cast them with RB while wielding a sword and shield.  In Skyrim, you must assign a spell to one hand or the other, so it kind of feels like you have lost your RB button.  I can understand this complaint.However, if you have posted about this, keep in mind that your RB button is not idle. It has been reserved for shouts, and you will obtain shouts eventually although you have to play along the main quest until you get the first one.  I have none as yet because I am focused on the mages' guild for now.  However once you do you get shouts, you can instantly cast them with RB while also dual wielding whatever you choose.The bottom line though is that this game is basically like Oblivion on steroids.  If you liked Oblivion and spent 200+ hours playing it like I did, you will be addicted to Skyrim.  Having playing all through yesterday and now it's 4 am and I'm getting up to play some more rather than get some sleep, this is probably the best game I've ever played.  That's a lot of praise coming from a life long gamer.  Again, so long as you like RPG's as opposed to say, MW3 (which a lot of people are playing non stop right now as well), this is the game for you.  BTW $65 almost feels like a very low price if you were to actually measure out how many hours you are going to spend playing this game over the next year or so, and divide it by $65.  I could spend $65 in a heartbeat at say, a Jets game at the Meadowlands, but that money goes a LONG way when playing Skyrim.To sum up...why am I wasting my time typing this review?  Time to go play Skyrim."
"If you're a fan of the Elder Scrolls series, you'll enjoy this game very much.  Not much else to say about it other than that.  It's an awesome game."
"I bought this game back in march and quit playing because of two glitches after only about an hour and a half in.The glitches I ran into were this after playing about an hour my xbox freezes and I lose most of what I had already done. The second time I was into the game about an hour and a half and for some reason I got stuck in place and couldnt move around. I could look around , swing my sword , cast spells but just couldnt get out of that spot. I then just turned the game off put it back in its box and put it in the drawer with the rest of my games.Well about a month later and my friends telling me the game had been patched I gave it another go. I sure am glad I did. I would have been missing out on what has turned out to be one of my favorite games. As far as I can tell all of the glitches have been patched because the only thing that happened while I was playing was a little lagg for just a short minute.Once I started playing again and really got into the game I just couldnt stop playing. It is just that good. I absolutely had Skyrim on my brain no matter where I was. just like right now I am at work typing this review. From the two main quest lines to the side quests with the guilds this game is just plain fun. I never got board with this game. If I wasnt on some quest I was collecting materials to build new armor and weapons. My favorite armor build was the Ebony armor with the Nightingale hood and those upgraded to legendary. I posted some pics of my armor on amazon so check those out. I think in my humble opinion that that is the best looking mix of armor you can get. That Nightingale hood just sets it off.This is a late review as I have completed the game and the dlc expansion Dawnguard. I have maxed out my character to level 81 and am waiting for the release of the next dlc. Since I have completed most things in the game I decided to go back in time and bought Oblivion and have been playing that. I must say Oblivion is no slouch because that game even dated as it is is amazing as well. I could keep rambling on an on about Skyrim or even Oblivion but I will put this to an end.If you were on the fence about this game just go ahead and take the plunge because you simply wont regret it. All of the patches have fixed this game completely , you shouldnt run into any glitches. The dlc Dawnguard and Hearth fire are simply amazing. I just cant say enough good things about this and dont have the time right now so just go ahead and get this amazing game."
"Todd Howard and the Betheseda have been known for their coveted Elder Scrolls series for many years. With a 5 year development cycle, each iteration while having the same core game introduces elements that  define the game. The 5th one's introduction of dragons and fully realizing their story was breathtaking. The open-world experience and ability to make your character into whoever you like set this game apart in 2011 & outdoes all of its predecessors. Go pick this up now!!!!"
"First and foremost, I have to give props to the art department at Bethesda. The art direction for this game is so far above earlier titles that even comparing them to this game is utterly pointless. Its literally in a class by itself and this is evident everywhere you look. The most obvious and impressive improvement has to be the design of the clothing, armor and weapons. The intricate designs are truly breathtaking. Even the cheap equipment you first start off with is stunning. For example, one of the first shields your introduced to in the game is the Hide Shield and its absolutely beautiful. Large metal rivets circle the outer diameter and intricate designs adorn the leather. It even has the dents and nicks one would expect to see from a shield that has seen its fair share of battle. This attention to detail is seen everywhere and it goes right down to the bindings of the books and the crackle glazed dishes and pottery found adorning most tables and halls. When you add this to the significant improvement in graphics....well, what you get is a level of realism that simply blows earlier titles out of the water. This is hands down the best art direction I have ever seen from a video game and ultimately it gives this world a level of realism that we simply haven't seen before.The world itself is absolutely beautiful. One of the first open scenes I came across was a large flowing river that had huge rocks jetting up creating white water/rapids. Large mountains were in the background with wisps of clouds running all up and down the side of the mountain. It was absolutely stunning. I had to just stop and stare for a few moments. The draw distance has been significantly increased and the detail, as I wrote up above, is amazing. The landscape itself is just one big work of art. Traveling around and discovering the land for yourself has always been one of the big enjoyments for fans of this series. Well, Skyrim doesn't disappoint in this regard. In fact, this is easily the best title yet in regards to this aspect of the game. No other game series can compete with the size and scope of the worlds that Bethesda creates for this series and no other game in the Elder Scrolls series even comes close to matching what Bethesda has achieved this time around with Skyrim. They have significantly leapfrogged anything and everything they have done in the past.An issue I feel compelled to discuss is the huge improvement with the 3rd person perspective in this game. As I am sure people are aware, 3rd person perspective in Oblivion was pretty bad. Actually, it was awful. You could switch over for short periods but the game was pretty much unplayable from that perspective. Well, the improvement Bethesda has made in this aspect of the game is nothing short of amazing. Your character no longer looks like he is walking on air and your easily able to interact with your environment. Basically this game is now wholly playable from this perspective. I prefer playing in 3rd person perspective when I am just traveling around and its just really nice to see Bethesda finally take the proper steps to fix this aspect of this series. If your going to include it than at least make it playable and Bethesda has done just that.You can immediately tell that this is an Elder Scrolls game but dont let that fool you. There are a lot of changes behind Skrim. One of the most obvious changes is with the skill system. The skills themselves are pretty much the same. You have Alchemy, Illusion, Conjuration, Destruction, Restoration, Alteration, Enchanting, Heavy Armor, Light Armor, Block, One Handed, Two Handed, Archery, Sneak, Lockpicking, Pickpocket, Speech and a new one Smithing. The big difference lies in the fact that you now have specialty skills for each skill category and there are multiple branching paths one can take. For example, the Stealth skill has two different branches that one can take, one that focuses on stealth (Muffled Movement, Light Foot, Silent Roll, ect.) and one that focuses on blade skills (Backstab, Deadly aim, and Assassins blade). This ultimately adds a significant amount of depth to character progression and it also adds to the games re-playability factor as there are now so many different avenues one can take. On top of this there are no longer character classes. You still have the different races of character to choose from but choosing a class is history. What kind of character you become (Spellcaster, Fighter etc.) is solely dependent on the skills you choose to upgrade or in other words its dependent on how you play your character. Personally I love this new system as it doesn't lock you into a specific mold for your character and it leaves everything open for you to explore. Its just a far more organic system and ultimately I think its a significant step forward for this series in regards to character development.Another big change is with the menu system and this is easily one of the best changes made in this game. The new menu system is just far more intuitive. Basically the menu system has been broken down into 4 distinct categories. There is Skills, Items, Map, and Magic. You have to press the menu button to access the menu but once you do that, you no longer need to press buttons. Simply press the left stick in the direction of the menu you want and it automatically changes. Once you have done this, a new subsystem of selections will come up and pressing the left stick to the right will take you to the next menu and so on. No button pressing needed. Basically the left thumb stick controls all of your movements within the menu system, with no button pressing needed. I may not have described it very well but its hands down one of the best menu systems I have ever used. Again, its just a far more intuitive system and it just has a great feel to it. You never leave the main screen when accessing menu's. It just blurs out a bit and acts as a background to the menus themselves. This basically does two things, it helps to keep the menus from detracting from the game itself and it ultimately makes the menu system far more attractive. They have also updated the item menu with 3 dimensional representations of the in game items. You can now spin items around a 360 degree axis, both vertical and horizontal. Its a small detail but a very cool one, especially for the weapons and armor.I also have to mention the skill menu as the way they have graphically laid this system out is...well, its nothing short of stunning. Each individual skill is represented by a constellation in the sky and beautiful gaseous nebula act as a background to the constellations. The visual effect is gorgeous. You can cycle left or right through the skills/constellations and when you access the branching skill set associated with each skill, you suddenly zoom into the constellation itself and the different branching skills are suddenly represented by the individual stars in that particular constellation. Its kind of difficult to properly explain but trust me, the effect is not only stunning, its also nothing short of ingenious. Its EASILY one of the best, if not the best, molds of form and function I have seen yet in videogames. Words simply cant do this games art direction justice. It really has to be seen firsthand to be fully appreciated.Combat has also been overhauled and what we wind up with is a system that is far more fluid, and ultimately a lot more fun, than previous releases. Characters are now able to duel wield both weapons and spells and can even mix up the two. In other words, you can assign a sword to one hand and a spell to another hand or you can go with a staff in one hand and a spell in the other. You can mix it up anyway you want. This new system fits perfectly with the new character system (that being one with no character classes). By adding so many options in regards to how to approach combat, they have essentially added strategy to the mix, something that was entirely lacking in Oblivion. Well, short of actually picking what character class you were actually going to play in oblivion. Basically the combat is just far superior to what we had with Oblivion. Unfortunately you can no longer assign weapons and spells to the D-pad and this is really one of my only complaints with the game. I dont understand why Bethesda decided to get rid of this. They could have even split the D-pad field in two, to accommodate the dual wielding nature of the game. In other words, they could have made the 4 slots on the left for the left hand and the 4 right slots on the right for the right hand. That would still have given you 4 quick slots for each hand.There are lots of other aspects to this game that have been updated but I will leave the rest of them for the player to discover and while there are lots of new additions to Skyrim, fortunately there is also a lot that hasn't changed. Traveling is still done the same way. Once you have actually discovered a location you have the option to fast travel to that location. There are still lots of different factions that one can join, all of which have additional quests associated with them. You can still go about playing the game as you want. You still collect herbs and ingredients for potions. There are still hundreds of different books that one can read. I could go on and on and on and on. This is an Elder Scrolls game after all and Bethesda has kept the heart of the game intact and that is a very good thing indeed. I wont go into the story aspect of this game as I hate spoilers. I will just say that the main story line is fantatstic and is really the icing on the cake.Bottom line - I am a huge Elder Scrolls fan and I have been watching this game since it was first announced. To say my expectations were extremely high would be a massive understatement. With that being said, Skyrim is everything that I hoped for and then some. It hasn't just raised the bar, its launched it into the stratosphere. If your an Elder Scrolls fan then buying this should be a no brainer. This is the kind of game people buy consoles for and this is easily Bethesda's best work yet in regards to this series. They have just taken this franchise to a whole new level. Thankfully, I have lots of time in the coming months to discover all that this game has to offer and make no mistake about it, what this game has to offer....well, its limited only by the amount of time you spend with it.Outstanding, simply outstanding!5 Stars!"
"Land of the Nords.  The Nords have sprouted some serious brain cells. These are the smartest Nords so far.  Completely removed from the almost childlike figures of Morrowind or sinister villians of Oblivion.  They are heartly and war driven.  Tough, kind, smart.  I never wanted to play a Nord until Skyrim.200 years have passed since the Oblivion Crisis.  The Altmer (high elves) have organized and attacked Tamriel, concquering most of it.  (Only the Redguard suceeded in fighting them off)  Conquered, the Imperial government agrees to the White Gold Concordat which would allow shared control over the Empire with one major condition:  Talos cannot be worshiped as a god!!!  The Imperials agree reluctantly but continue to struggle to find a way to regain full control.  Meanwhile, a civil war has broken out in Skyrim, home of Talos.  Ulfric Stormcloak will not abandon Talos worship and has rallied half the country to his cause.  When he murders the high king and declares himself the ruler of Skyrim, the Imperial Army send General Tullius to take him down.You, as always, get dragged into the fight.  But there is something a bit different about you.  After being attacked by dragons, you learn that you alone can defeat their leader.  Can you do it and brink peace to Skyrim as well."
"this game is a challenging game. if you don't take the chance to save when you can, and you die, you have to start over at the last time you did get to save...so, save often. lots of fun."
This game is great I love on the elder scrolls series its great I would recommend this game to everyone which is good
"this is really awesome and theres so much to do. graphics are great and all that, blah blah blah. the only problem is combat is kinda lame, how is it i can fight a huge ass dragon no problem but then walking through the forest i get mauled by a bear. really? so stupid. dark souls got that combat thing on lock."
"You'll obviously read some very mixed reviews regarding this game. As an open world RPG, the style of gameplay by its very nature brings about polarizing opinions. However, the other element to such an expansive game is the opportunity for gameplay bugs, some of which potentially game breaking, to occur. So, with that in mind, I would say this is still an all timer in my opinion. There are definitely bugs in the game. I own all three versions and have found that my preference is for the 360 version. There just seems to be more tech support for this version than the others. However, PC has mods, which are pretty awesome. Sadly, although the PS3 is actually my preferred gaming choice, the PS3 version of this game doesnt feature the dedicated support offered for the other versions, and the bugs and glitches really tend to stand out. I have 70% achievements for the game on PS3 but cant finish due to a game breaker at Aldruins Wall that hasnt been fixed after more than a year of gamers reporting it. Anyway, point being, for this game, I think the optimal version is the 360 version. As an added bonus, the 360 version gets DLC before the other two (actually, PS3 has yet to receive Dawnguard or Hearthfire, which have now been on the market for several months now).Now, for the game itself. The graphics are pretty jaw dropping. The world is stunning visually, and really seems to be a living breathing world with vibrant colors, shapes, and sounds. The dungeons are pretty amazing, and often feature a nice looping design, wherein the exit point is always near the entrance, meaning you dont ever need to backtrack. Once you finally are able to delve beneath the dwarven ruins, you will find another piece of the world that will truly blow you away with its originality and beauty, mixed with the ever present sense of danger (Blackreach). Dragons...they are intense and awesome! I can really keep going on and on. This game can steal a few real time months of your life away from you if you let it. Hours can seem like minutes when you're playing.A couple other nice features: dual wield (weapon/shield, two weapons, weapon/spell, spell/shield, 2 spells, double strength spell), enhanced character design features, awesome death scenes, epic quests, interesting enhanced take on werewolf/vampire play with cool quest/story arcs, dragon shouts (which are amazing in their variety and power), dual main questlines (rather than having one main quest, there are essentially two primary storylines with of course 100's of other unrelated quests), a different and really cool way to level up and neat interface for that as well as your typical equip/journal/etc...pages...just to name a few things.This game truly is epic, and you really cant go wrong regardless of the format you choose, but personally, for this game, I recommend the 360 version. Enjoy!"
"This is one of the, if not the best game on the 360 console. I am amazed on how much content is in this game its the bigger than any of the gta or fallout series with almost a endless amount of quest. I can go on forever about how good this game is if you haven't try this buy it you will not regret it."
"Oh, my. Well, I have been playing Oblivion since its release (about 7 characters that got around level 47, with about 300 hours each), and now, finally, last night (midnight launch, yay). I was able to start playing Skyrim. This IS one of the very few games that ""lives up to the hype."" I know I don't have to go into detail, those of you who are also playing it, especially if you have been along for the Elder Scrolls evolution journey, know EXACTLY what I am talking about. Those few of you trolls, that like to post poor reviews on games like this, just to get all of us riled up, guess what, I just ignore you.Anyway, this will be sort of brief, because, first, I only have a few hours in (dang it I fell asleep at about 0400), and, more importantly, after this I'm getting right back to it. Without being too ""spoilery,"" as they say at Bethesda, you start out (as usual), as a prisoner. You get asked a question that throws you into ""character creation."" Something happens (like last time) that will facilitate your escape. This first ""quest"" is basically a tutorial for you; like last time, once you exit this area and come out into the world, you are free to either continue the main story quest, or do whatever you like. Also as before, you have picked up quite a bit of gear relative to your beginning encumbrance (I started at 300). So, first thing I did of course, was look for a shop, and sold most of that stuff off, and made me some gold. Right now, I'm just exploring on my own; I already have the next stops in the main quest, and about 5 other side or miscellaneous quests, acquired by just talking to folks, in my journal.On the difference in ""skills"" and ""leveling:"" I like it. The way it works now, instead of simply getting to 50 in a skill, and becoming a ""journeyman,"" when you level up (I'm level 2 now), you go to a menu that looks like constellations in the skey, and you pick whether to increase your Health, Magicka, or Stamina. Then, comes the cool part...you receive a ""perk;"" you can either spend the perk you receive then, or save it for later. You can use a perk when you meet the skill level it requires, and have the pre-requisite perk already (i.e. you can't use one perk to jump from novice to master...you have to move up the 'skill tree' in order). What all this means is, YOU can select what you become expert at; you can be a warrior character and rise quickly to master of illusion etc. I like this MUCH better than Oblivion's ""rest and meditate on what you have learned,"" etc.The main reason the Elder Scrolls games are my favorites is, they are that rare ""open world"" ""open choice"" game. You can do the main quest, and nothing else. You  can spend hundreds of hours wandering on your own, clearing out caves, fighting bandits, etc, and never touch any quests at all. You can do a faction quest, and nothing else. You can be a good knight (if you don't do the theives guild/dark brotherhood quests), or go around killing everyone you see. It's ALL up to you.Well I can't stand it, I'm going to save this review, and go play Skyrim for the rest of the day. If you have the game, you know what I'm talking about. if you don't, get it. The words highly recommended don't do it justice. As far as how I would rate it: 5 out of 5 10 out of 10, you get the idea.Ok really, I'm going now. GET THIS GAME."
"Having my head down in books and work, this release pleasantly snuck up on me. Having ultimately (it became an acquired taste) really enjoyed the previous Oblivion title (I managed all achievements, so that must mean something?), I immediately picked up this title. It was a mixed experienced.The good:* WAY improved inventory/menu system.* Improved combat system.* Longer, more involved leveling (previous cheats were removed, such as acrobatics).* Larger monsters.* Improved mapping system (the last was so incredibly painful).* Improved visuals.The bad:* Cooking was added, however, it seemed pointless.* Story is not as tight as the previous, no Patrick Stewart, however, it is still interesting.* The graphics were a step up, just a little step.The ugly:* I encountered at least 3 completely broken sub-quests.* Direction is often lost, ""What was I doing? Why?""Summary: A must buy!"
a never-ending adventure with choices you make. you create a character from scratch and build skills through quests. and dragon slying
"If you plan in playing this game for an hour and never play it again, you're playing a trick on yourself. I picked up the controller and couldn't put it down. There is so much to do in this. You never run out of fun. Maybe the coolest part about this game is the graphics. It might have the best graphics of any game out there. Great game,  I recommend it."
"Wow the reviews were right. This is a great game with great graphics and fun gameplay. If you like RPGs and FPS's, this combines the two nicely. Get it if you can. For Xbox 360, though. Unless you have a powerful enough PC to run it. I heard it has problems on the PS3."
"If you already have or played the previous Elder Scrolls games then this shouldn't surprise you with either its vast open world exploration and massive quests or the feeling of actually being in this world.  What makes this so enjoyable to play is you aren't stuck as a fixed character class or fixed appearance, like with the earlier games this one allows you to choose your race,sex and appearance before truly starting the game meaning if you want to be a male dark elf or female redguard it's your choice to pick. What's also appreciated about the game is that there is no fixed time allotment meaning you can explore or do as many  quests as you what before going back to the main quests which is also pretty much expected to help you garner experience to level up and to gain reputation and property ownership of houses and the like in different villages.Just remember to also use your head, don't go taking on a group of giants with a short sword head-to-head build up your character because if you think it's easy to defeat all these creatures and find out it isn't all you'll feel is annoyed. So for fans of fantasy RPG vast open world games without the trouble of going online to play it here's a great game to buy....."
"What is to be said that hasn't already been said by others?  If you enjoy creating a character and launching into the exploration of an open world full of quests, dangers to overcome and a &#34;special&#34; past to discover, this is the state-of-the-art."
I started Skyrim and after getting through the intro I looked at the options and it was overwhelming. I had to turn it off to start it when I have more time. I expect this game to last as long or longer than Fallout 3. Just imagining how long this game is going to take from start to finish is exciting enough. I really really really hate getting short changed on a game. The Halo series games were just way too short. I finished Halo games in an hour. It took me almost two years to finish Fallout 3 and I expect Bethesda to pull off the same LONG game in this Skyrim version of elder scrolls. This is a great game no doubt!
Do not even start this game unless you have the whole summer off or something (which luckily I did!). It will suck you in and next things you know 2 months have gone by and you haven't done anything but play Skyrim.
"That sounds like an over the top boast right? It really isn't. This really is one of the better games ever made. The amount of play time alone gives you a good reason to buy this game. If you are a big fan of sword and magic type stories or games this is the perfect game for you. The music, the story, and the gameplay are all fantastic. But what really makes this game shine is the adventure, the exploration it allows. It is all open world and encourages you to go out and adventure. I've put in over 500 hours into this game and plan on putting in at least another 100. Great game. One of the best."
"The title sums it up. This is the best game for me. I have been playing for like 20 years already (yeah, i am that old, 34 and counting ;)), and I am not really too emotional about games anymore. Don't take me wrong, it is my only hobby, and I play a lot. I would say I saw it all already. Skyrim returned me that already nearly forgotten feeling of wonder and owe I had as a teenager. Like the first time I played Gothic 1-2, or M&M; games, or Morrowind. By some reason Oblivion did not work for me, but Skyrim worked a miracle. Now I cannot sleep or concentrate on my job, because I am totally under the influence of this digitized drug called TES 5 Skyrim.It is so addictive it should be illegal, or at least should come with a warning from surgeon general and with a list of crisis hot-line number for addicted players. Shame on you Bethesda for leaving us without emergency psychological care ;)"
"Such a fantastic game. These are some glitches that you can research before starting specific quests, but most of the time things ran smoothly and I just enjoyed an amazing game."
"I've been long awaiting the release of Skyrim, and now that it's here I'm utterly blown away. The improvements that Bethesda have more over Skyrim's predecessor,Oblivion are apparent instantly while watching the game's opening. Skyrim uses the same format as previous Morrowind games for its introduction. You're character is a prisoner who must escape their bonds and quickly gets wrapped up in the current political/mystical going on's of the time. I don't understand why the Morrowind writer's keep using the same story line, but it seems to be a pretty effective way to get the ball rolling.After you escape, the world of Skyrim is your oyster. Once I was out in the open I was amazed at how improved the graphics and character models where. The models you use to create your character are more detailed and have been enhanced to allow for more customization. I chose to play as a Khajit(they make great rouges) and I was impressed at how I could even change the stripe patterns on his fur. The character models have improved by leaps and bound since Oblivion and no longer have the cartoonish quality they once had.One thing that I'm still getting used to is the weapon and magic menus. The game allows you to equip a weapon in one hand and a magic spell in other which helps you be more effective in combat. The problem I'm having is that I find myself constantly going to the weapons menu to change from a sword to a bow and other weapons. Though I find it tricky to rifle through my equipment and constantly stopping in middle of combat is an annoyance, I'm going to give it more time to to get accustomed to and assume that the game has a bit of a learning curve. Skyrim also has a ""finishing move"" feature. When you're close enough to your foe and their health is low, you can do a cool impaling strike or decapitation. they're very fun to pull off.The world of Skryim is a world in every sense of the word. Enormous mountains dot the terrain accompanied by roaring rivers and lush forest. I've only completed a few missions and raided a few dungeons but I feel Skyrim is much much larger than Oblivion and has more to offer. Your enemies also look more menacing and had amusing quips during combat. One thief said that I'd ""make a nice rug"" referring to my Khajit fur. I've seen a map of Skyrim showing the locations of all the dungeons and to say there's hours of game play to be had is an understatement.In closing, do yourself a favor. Stray from the beaten path. Wonder out to the woods. Climb that intimidating mountain. If you only focus on the main story arch and rush though this game, you're doing yourself a disservice. The game is meant to be explored and will reward you for doing so. Venture forth."
"Awesome game with great mechanics and compelling storylines and missions. Can definitely get addicted and lost in this game, fun."
"I'm a fan of Bethesda's previous RPG's, especially Fallout 3. This, though, is on a whole other level. Skyrim has a good combat system, the main storyline is interesting, and the characters are intriguing. The graphics are good-not-great, and there are bugs throughout.But the beauty of this game doesn't come from any of that. The beauty is that this, more than any other game, feels like a complete and believable world full of things to explore and do. You can start up the game, pick a direction, and aimlessly wander and you will find something captivating to do. You might stumble across a group of giants, herding their mammoths, and have to sneak around them. You might stumble across a town just in time to see a dragon swoop down and start shooting flames at the townsfolk, who desperately need your help. You might get in a drinking contest in a tavern, blackout, and have to retrace your steps. You can just sit in the house and read one of the hundreds of books you found on your adventure and learn more about Skyrim's people, politics and religions. You might read a book that mentions a warrior's long lost magical battleaxe, and then set off to find this treasure. You could join a thieves guild, become a werewolf, buy the perfect horse, get married, or rob people blind.Basically, lots of hours of your real life are going to disappear as you enjoy your new life as the Dragonborn, savior of Skyrim.If you like RPG's, get this. If you like fantasy games, get this. If you like action games, get this. If you're just in it for the story, get this.Adventure awaits! Specifically, YOUR adventure. And it will be as great as you want it to be."
Love the game and the story line and the characters.  After several months I still enjoy playing this game.  Just when I thought I had explored everything I find something or someone new.  I recommend.
"Bethesda is a company I trust to create the best games. They put so much quality and effort into their games you can't help but to smirk and think ""wow, that is awesome"" when you play their games (Oblivion, Fallout 3) and see how much work went into the presentation.Skyrim: what can I say that hasn't been said? It's a fantastic experience, packed with so much detail, people, locations and quests you could play it just to sight-see. It is worth every cent to play and makes me wonder when the day will come that companies like Bethesda realize they're giving away too much value.Graphics: incredible; they pushed the Xbox to the limit. The draw scale is farther out so mountains and major landmarks and water are visible. The snow and shadows look terrific and create a cold, moody atmosphere as is fitting for a game leaning heavily on Scandinavian culture. The interior of buildings are filled with objects (so many you often forget your quest in order to examine them) and exceptional attention to details.Sound: awesome music that underscores the content; FX are perfect (although I do hear repetition in certain character voices)Playability: outstanding; certainly with so much going on in the game you'll see texture flips and some hiccups here and there but these guys are pulling off a masterpiece here. Forgive the small stuff for the bigger picture. I'm just amazed how much performance they continue to get out of the Xbox's processor.Buy it. Play it. Love it."
This is the biggest game I have ever played. The world they have created is beautiful.  The graphics are top notch and the gameplay is solid.  I am not an RPG player but this game is awesome.
"I am not a big gamer, so take that into consideration. I do prefer Role Playing Games (RPG) so other types though. As far as that goes, I think this is the best of its kind. There is so much free will in this game. You will never play the same game twice. The realism is also amazing, both for the quality of graphics and just the type of interactions between characters that can happen. Bears act like bears. Bandits act like bandits. You can sneak away. Everything doesn't indiscriminantly attack you. Like the real world, you have to pay attention to your surroundings. You can fall off a cliff and die. You can be surprised by wild animals. Everything doesn't level up when you do. Some creatures are really weak and some are strong. You have to spend a LOT of time just getting to know yourself and your world, but if you are into RPG, it will be well spent."
"Definitely a great buy at the now $30 price.  Very good game that you will get many, many hours of engrossing play out of.  You will also get some moments of frustration, sheer boredom and find things to be disappointed about too.Below I will give my opinion on a few key areas:First, Repetition:  Its Fallout 3 with a major makeover.  So much like fallout 3 that, a few years after playing that game, I feel like I have just jumped back into it but in a different setting.  You spend a lot of time collecting stuff to sell - you are always chasing gold in this game.  You do a lot of walking and dungeon crawling and the landscape is very similar to that in Fallout 3 and the dungeons are very similar to the vaults as well. Bodies, both human and animal, looks and mechanics, are right out of Fallout 3.  One thing I was really disappointed in because it just gets so annoying after playing the game a while is the way every vendor uses the exact same line when you go to buy or sell items:  "" Well, I've got a bit of this and a bit of that...""  Seems they could've had vendors in different cities have different lines to speak - considering how often you will be hearing them.  Oh yeah, just for the record, I loved Fallout 3 (I bought that game after it had a year to fix bugs as well).Second, Gameplay Issues:  Being a very complex, open world type game for the most part, its possible that the order of doing things can cause problems with some missions/player goals ranging from outright bugs to just having made choices that cancel out other options in the game.  You figure which was the cause of a character not responding to your dialog during a quest. As for actual crashes or freezes, I am now at level 20 and have had only 4 console freezes where I had to manually power off the 360 - all when simply walking down the road from one location to another.Of course, anyone who has experienced a Bethesda game has come to expect many bugs and glitches and broken games if you buy it at launch, which this has lived up to, but after being out a year they have managed to reduce them to a pretty acceptable level from what I've seen so far. Just remember to save before you leave an area and start walking down a path.  I am playing on the 4 GB 360 with no HDD and load times when entering areas, even just a building, can take a very long time.  You are also presented with just a solid black screen, giving no indication if anything is loading or it just froze.  I will actually leave for a few minutes and come back to see if it was just a slow load or if it did actually freeze the console.  I have had load times for areas that make it into the MINUTES of loading time rather than seconds.  Let's say you have junk you want to sell - fast travel to the town - loading...  enter store - loading...  sell stuff and exit store - loading...  travel back to your next quest - loading...  sometimes waiting minutes for a single load.  You will be thinking, ""Wow, what an absolute chore just to ""quickly"" unload this stuff for some coin"".Third, RPG Elements:  Although you can say that it has been simplified considerably compared with some past hardcore RPG type games, it is still a game that will have you spending copious amounts of time in the menus dealing with character attributes such as skills, weapons, potions/spells and the like. You can do smithing (making/upgrading weapons & armor), and alchemy (making potions similar to crafting in New Vegas)and enchanting (adding magical attributes to weapons & armor).  You can even make metals from smelting ore and tan hides to make leather to use as materials.  In the same vein as repairing your weapons in Fallout 3, in Skyrim you have to keep refilling soul gems to power your enchanted weapons.  You can also eat and sleep.  AND - most all of this is pretty optional if you prefer a mostly first person shooter approach to the game.I like it the way it is in this respect because they have achieved a good balance of RPG and Action that keeps it interesting and flowing.  And it still sucks hours of your time in each sitting.  I would say you need a minimum of 2 hrs per session for this game but that is just to go in and do something quick like sell a bunch of stuff, mess with weapons/armor or turn in a mission you already finished. Otherwise figure on 4 to 6 hrs and up - per session - to play this thing.There is no doubt that Bethesa chose to maximize profit by copying almost everything from Fallout 3 and still release what was essentially a beta when they did Skyrim but, at the same time, its what we all have come to expect from the corporate gaming world - keep selling the same for as long as possible.Despite that, this is a very good game in its genre and I like it.  If you loved Fallout 3 then you will love this game as well but you may tire if it quickly too because of that ""same-old"" look and feel to it."
"There is a point at which we find ourselves experiencing something that we realize is special. An experience where you step back from a movie or a game and just wrap your head around what it took to create such an experience.  For me,  I experienced this as I was moving into my 3rd bandit encampment..I was searching around for loot and decided to shoot my fireball magic at a spider web in a corner that looked a bit concealed.  Sure enough the webs burned back and in their place was a chest, carefully hidden within a pile of various junk..  In it I found a strage sword I had not previously seen with powers that I don't understand just yet.  This is what gaming to me represents on the most basic of levels.  That sense of discovery and wonder that comes with a really good book you can't put down or simply don't want to.  Skyrim is that game for me. I played Oblivion for long hours, died a million times in Demon/Dark Souls,  cut my teeth on pretty much every final fantasy game that was released (ok not so much the latest offering) and also love to shoot some people up in matchmaking FPS type games.  My tastes go all over the board and as we own pretty much all of the systems including handhelds.. that's alot.  But this game is by far the most engrossing and complete game I have ever played.There is something to be said for games that make you prepare just to play them.  Each time I set out with the limited time I usually have to play (a father of 3 kids)  I usually start out by going into a town and buying anything I might need on my next exploration.  I carefully check my potions and equipment..  Talk to every single NPC to get any and all missions possible and then.... I set out.This is what makes this game so much fun for me.  It is truly infinite in it's ability to allow me, the gamer, to do pretty much anything I want to.  I can go and tackle a particular side quest and find that individual experience as epic as most games make you feel after completion because you can do so many things and do them in so many different ways.  The enemies are diverse, the loot is vast, the landscapes are varied and breathtaking.  The NPCs are lifelike in their daily activities.  You have to study the habits of some people to know when to interact.  It is truly the most immersive fantasy experience I have enjoyed since I rolled a 12 sided dice WAY back in the day. The sense of wonder this game creates is simply incredible.I have seen the few poor reviews and most of them were because the person buying the game was expecting something else or because they champion another game (like dark souls - people you can rate BOTH games high! You don't need to knock one down to make the other better!) If you know what Bethesda is good at and are buying that level of polish then you know what you are getting but I'm here to tell you that this game surpasses my very high hopes for it.  The graphics are simply gorgeous.  The quests are interesting and varied though there is alot of fetch quests they are interesting because of the locals and enemies that make the experiences varied.  The mythos is compelling and detailed.  Reading books are not simply time wasting but fill in lore or even better... actually help you level up.  Every action that you take (sneaking or shooting an arrow) improve your stealth numbers and your archery skills and do it with a satisfying chorus of voices celebrating your minor accomplishment. This also directly impacts your overall level and skills in that area.  What you do is reflected on every level- morality based or visually and that is simply EPIC.  The sound is emmersive and constant, the music is classical but sets the tone very nicely.There are some bugs that bother you a little but taken as a body of work Bethesda will eventually fix those and provide new reasons to continue exploring this detailed world.  It is a masterpiece pure and simple and should not be passed over. If you don't like RPGs..  Pass on it. That's pretty obvious (1 star reviews)- but if you like to build a character and love exploring a vast and beautiful land this game will likely eat up 300+ hours (from early reports).Buy it and prepare to be floored with the detail and interface. The only drag to me as has been mentioned many times is the magic/ combat interface which is a bit cumbersome but you do have time to switch as combat will pause as you do. But I do find that to be a design flaw not present in Obivion.  Not a big deal within the bigger picture and this game is easily worth every penny you put into it because of it's size and replay value.  Good or bad?  Play it again and choose the other side.  What a time to be a gamer this holiday!!!"
"After sinking in a over 80+ hours in the game already, I can safely say this game fixed a lot of the glaring flaws that was in Oblivion.+Graphics are improved quite a bit. (Faces, weapons, armor, scenery, etc.)+Leveling mechanics are overhauled so you do not need to make your major perks into minor perks so you don't grow weaker with level.+Fallout 3's lockpicking mini-game is back for the third time.+Enemies only level you up so far so bandits will not be equipped with glass armor at later levels, finally making you feel more powerful later on.+Skyrim uses same amount of land as Oblivion, but there are many more dungeons and landmarks to visit.+Blacksmithing and enchanting let you make the gear you want for your character, albeit if it's a Khaijiit Assasin, a big Nord Warrior, or an Argonian Mage!-Magic system leaves a bit to desired, especially with Destruction Magic at higher difficulty levels. (You will need to use a variety of spell schools to survive. Spellcrafting is not available in this game, sadly.)-No unarmed skills at all unless you use enchanting to disenchant a certain pair of gloves in-game.Mind you, these negatives isn't bad enough to stop me from playing this excellent Bethesda open-world game. I cannot mention any more slight negatives as I do not wish to spoil the game. most of their negatives are alleviated by buying this for the PC though.This is a worthy purchase, especially with the DLC."
"Skyrim is a great RPG that I can play without the stress of Call Of Duty games. I love the fantasy/sci-fi based games, like World of Warcraft. And Skyrim taps the interest. I could play these games forever. I hope they keep coming out with new releases."
"All that needs to be said is EPIC GAME!!! If you have not played this game and your a fan of rpgs and knights, dragons and swords, you should go out and buy this as soon as possible!"
"As a FRPG gamer dating back to the origins of D & D (before there was an AD & D), we used to wish for a video game that could capture the feel of being an adventurer. To be swept into a world that didn't feel linear...where your actions had consequence. SKYRIM has done that and more. This is an RPG that you can lose days of your life in if you aren't careful. Chose your destiny...decide on a personality and be good or evil...then do it again and see how a different action leads to a different path."
"The computer version is better for a few reasons.1.  I'm use to playing Elder Scrolls on Computer2.  Mods can be utilize on computer...not talking about the cheating ones...I liked the mods that added to the game, like houses, islands, tower defense, etc.However as for the game itself, it is really fun and a little different because all skills add to your main level.  This actually sucks and makes it hard because if you get a lot of your skill levels to max...the game becomes really hard and I don't want to have to turn the difficulty down...lol.  I don't see why me getting skills unrelated to combat up would raise my combat level...but oh well overall the game is pretty damn fun, but eventually as with most games becomes boring...there is always something to be desired."
"The graphics are sick, the game play is phenomenal, the story is wicked, you fight dragons! Need I say more?!"
"It arrived very quickly and in one piece, and when Christmas eve arrived and she opened the gift it wasn't damaged and worked. I am very happy."
"Skyrim is a BIG HEADACHE for me! and this is why:Since I bought this game arround two weeks ago I just can't do nothing but playing Skyrim all the time. I'm having too few sleeping hours due to the fact that I'm going to bed at 2-3am playing this (i'm not working at my full capacity at office because of this). My wife is MAD at me because I just want to be all the time playing this game and we don't hangout together any more. This is why SKYRIM IS A BIG HEADACHE TO ME!Seriously, this game is amazing. Highly adictive. Nicely done in every way. I consider myself a casual gamer...I usually don't spend too much time on videogames since I was a kid (I'm 32 now + 2 kids), but this game is awesome. Period."
This was a gift for my nephew and he just thought it was great. I look forward to more of these movies to buy fro him.
"Im a huge rpg fan, and this is by far one of the best ive ever played. would definitely recommend"
This is one of the greatest games i have ever played if not the greatest! it works well and definitely worth the buy!
"if you purchase this game say goodbye to the next month of your life. this game is awesome, great graphics awsome story line and the rest is for you to fine out."
"There really is no better open-world adventure game out there. The amount of different classes you can play easily makes this game replayable 5+ times. The graphics are great and there is virtually no lag throughout the game. The sky during the different times of the day is breathtaking. Buy this game, you will love it."
